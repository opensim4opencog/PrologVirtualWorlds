JNI example 
-----------

This is an example of how to write JNI using GCC on win32 and
works for both Cygwin B20.1+ and Mingw32. 

To build for Cygwin:
  
  % make -f Makefile.cyg

To build for Mingw using Cygwin GCC (fix paths to the mingw-extra package
in Makefile.cyg first):

  % make -f Makefile.nocyg

If you don't have make or your make can't handle the Makefile, use
the DOS makeit.bat file.
  
  C:> makeit

To run,
  
  % java Main
  Java JNI
  HOME = /c/Users/Khan
