Greetings, welcome to my readme. I threw this together because all the other
cool projects have one, and I just can't stand to be left out of "the loop".


Please note that at this time, the attached code is very... how shall I say... "hackish." That is to say that things will change very very much away from the data structures and API of this current proof-of-concept stage of the core code. There will be no basic stability until beta. I should also like to point out that this is alpha. Not beta.


All coders must wash hands before submitting patches. Killer robotic apes need
not apply. Curvey squid women inquire within, many positions available.



NECESSARY TOOLS/APIs

Sun's SDK 1.3.1 (or 1.4 beta 3)- http://java.sun.com/
No, earlier versions probably won't work. Yay bleeding edge!

ANT- http://jakarta.apache.org/ant
this is the build tool that I use to simplify compiling all the junk into some-
thing useful.

NanoXML- http://nanoxml.sourceforge.net/
the NanoXML/Java packages are used by jamud to parse and create xml. You'll
need nanoxml.jar in the lib directory in order to build or run anything.

The following packages may be used at some point in the future, so you may as
well take a look now. They're all related to scripting.

BSF- http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/projects/bsf/
Jython- http://www.jython.org/
Rhino- http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/




ANT BUILD TARGETS

clean -- removes all the files in bin, docs, and the generated jar files
build -- calls build-core, jar-core, build-plugins, and jar-plugins
build-core -- compiles the src/jamud/ tree (the jamud.* packages)
build-plugins -- compiles the src/com/ tree (the com.jamud.* packages)
jar-core -- creates jamud-core.jar in the lib directory
jar-plugins -- creates jamud-plugins.jar in the lib directory
run -- runs the mud
javadoc -- creates the javadoc html files in docs/api




OFFICIAL HOME PAGE(S)

http://www.jamud.com/
My $90/year hosting deal. Mostly it's just a bunch of PR pointing back at the
sourceforge pages.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/jamud/
The place to post messages, to find the latest builds, to report bugs, to
request features... all the normal things sourceforge offers.

http://papasmurf.datastacks.com/jamud/backups/cvs-recent/
A really old box in my closet. Please be kind. I do nightly CVS tarballs there
for the CVS-challenged. I occasionally run the mud on that machine on port
8808 (but that's pretty rare).
