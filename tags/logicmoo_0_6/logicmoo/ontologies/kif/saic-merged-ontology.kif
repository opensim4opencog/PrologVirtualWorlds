That is, from one perspective, elements of Money represent the amount of a debt (or credit), while from another perspective, they represent what is actually transferred to create or discharge a debt.  Typically, money is created by national governments; either (a) money is a backed claim for a certain amount of precious physical wealth payable by the government on demand (e.g., the gold standard), or (b) money is a legally enforced means of debt payment without any backing.  



Elements of Money in Cyc may be either a fixed amount, such as a U.S. five-dollar bill, or a range, such as `the price of a 1997 Mazda Protege'.  See Unit-Of-Money for the units used by Cyc to measure instances of Money. 



Note: The tangible coins, bills, checks, etc., that represent certain amounts of Money (but which as physical objects may have little value) are elements of Tender-Object, not of Money.  Elements of Tender-Object which also belong to Currency are typically associated with some instance of Unit-Of-Money (e.g., Dollar-United-States) and have a fixed value.")

can be in a class.  This includes all the relations and objects
defined in the KIF specification, plus all other objects defined in
user ontologies.  Every THING is either a simple-set or an individual.
  There are entities in the universe of discourse for KIF that cannot
be instances of THING.  These entities are unbounded objects, which by
definition cannot be members of any set.  Since THING is a class,
and classes are relations, and relations are sets, then unbounded
entities can't be instances of any class.
  That is why THING is defined here, as the practical root of all
ontologies.

<UL>Version 4: moved THING from the KIF ontology into the frame

It isn't defined in the KIF spec, and mainly serves to clarify the

modeled world, such as 'the earth's diameter' (a constant length) and
'the stress in a loaded deformable solid' (a measure of stress, which
is a function of three spatial coordinates).  The first type is called
constant-quantity and the second type is called function-quantity.
All physical quantities are either constant-quantities or
function-quantities.  Although the name and definition of this concept
is inspired from physics, physical quantities need not be material.
For example, amounts of money are physical quantities.  In fact,
all real numbers and numeric-valued tensors are special cases of physical 
quantities.  In engineering textbooks, quantities are often called variables.

   Physical quantities are distinguished from purely numeric entities
like a real numbers by their physical dimensions.  A
physical-dimension is a property that distinguishes types of
quantities.  Every physical-quantity has exactly one associated
physical-dimension.  In physics, we talk about dimensions such as
length, time, and velocity; again, _nonphysical_ dimensions such as
currency are also possible.  The dimension of purely numeric entities
is the identity-dimension.

   The 'value' of a physical-quantity depends on its type.  The value of
a constant-quantity is dependent on a unit-of-measure.  Physical
quantities of the identity-dimension (dimensionless quantities) are
just numbers or tensors to start with.  Physical quantities of the
type function-quantity are functions that map quantities to other
quantities (e.g., time-dependent quantities are function-quantities).
See the definitions of these other classes and functions for detail.
