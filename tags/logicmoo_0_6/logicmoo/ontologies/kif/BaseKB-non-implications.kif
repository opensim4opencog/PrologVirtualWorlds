Good examples of such couples are &%PublicTransportationDevice and &%PublicTransportationScheduleDocument or &%Dog and &%DogFood. The knowledge representation philosophy here is similar to that behind many &%RuleMacroPredicates.

(documentation equal "&%equal is an inference-related  predicate which appears in system-generated assertions; &%equal represents a mapping between a non-atomic term (NAT) and a  constant that was reified by the system especially for that NAT.  Assertions with &%equal are created by the system when a certain kind of non-atomic term (NAT) first appears in a  formula; such a NAT consists of a  function that is an element of &%Function, together with the correct number and type of arguments.  When such a NAT is first used in a formula, the  system automatically creates a -constant data-structure to reify the NAT.  A name is automatically assigned to the new constant (i.e., the data-structure) by the  system; currently (1997), the system is using for most of those constant names a string which is identical to the NAT.  One should not be misled by that into thinking that &%equal is a specialization of &%equals. 

The predicate &%equal maps between the system-generated data-structure and the original non-atomic term.  (&%equal NAT-CONSTANT NAT-EXPRESSION) tells us that the constant data-structure NAT-CONSTANT was created to reify the value of the non-atomic term NAT-EXPRESSION.  From now on, NAT-EXPRESSION will refer to the constant NAT-CONSTANT.

Examples of non-atomic terms (NATs) include: (&%Giga &%DollarsPerYear), (&%RepairingFn &%Automobile), and (&%TheScriptFn &%WashingClothesInAMachine). See also &%Function-Denotational, &%ReifiableTerm.

Note: &%equal assertions are entered in the &%ToplevelContext because the mapping between a NAT and the constant that was reified for it holds universally.  One should view &%equal assertions as bits of bookkeeping knowledge which are very rarely, if ever, entered into the KB by hand.")

(documentation Industry-Localized "Each element of the collection &%Industry-Localized is a particular &%Group of producers of a particular kind of good or service (usually in a defined geographic area).  For instance, the United States' automobile industry would be an element of &%Industry-Localized, and would have U.S. automobile manufacturers  like &%GeneralMotors, &%ChryslerTheCompany, &%FordTheCompany etc. as &%groupMembers.  For major economic sectors consisting of many industries, use &%EconomicSector-Localized and &%EconomicSectorType, which refer to larger groups.  Thus, 'the world agriculture sector', or 'the technology sector in the United States' refer to instances of &%EconomicSector-Localized rather than instances of &%Industry-Localized.  'The U.S. Automobile Industry' should be considered a sub-industry (see &%subIndustries) of 'The U.S. Industrial Sector'.  Note that specific kinds of industry (&%IndustryTypes like &%MetallurgyIndustry) are &%Collections of particular (often geographically defined) industries; they are not individual industries (instances of &%Industry-Localized) in this scheme.  That is, there are several instances of &%MetallurgyIndustry, such as the German metallurgy industry, the Mexican metallurgy industry, etc.  There is also the worldwide metallurgy industry.  These may be described as (&%IndustryOfRegionFn &%MetallurgyIndustry &%Germany), etc.  Thus the collection &%MetallurgyIndustry is a specialization, not an instance, of &%Industry-Localized.  See also &%ContextOfIndustryTypeFn and &%ContextOfIndustryOfRegionFn which create microtheories for the types and the individuals, respectively.")

(documentation Artifact "A collection of tangible things.  An instance of &%Artifact is a tangible which was more or less intentionally created by an &%Agent (or a group of &%Agents working together) to serve some purpose or perform some function.  By `created', we don't require that the matter itself be created, it is often just the result of some sort of assemblage or modification process, such as a wooden flute that's been whittled from a tree branch, a sawhorse that's been put together out of boards and nails, a coin that's been minted by embossing or by melting liquid silver into a mold, etc.

Let's consider some positive and negative examples.

In addition to the obvious human artifacts (buildings, tools, textiles, power lines), this collection includes certain sorts of things made by &%Animals, such as bird nests, termite mounds, and beaver dams.

Something which just barely squeaks through the intended meaning of this concept is &%YaleUniversity.  In addition to the abstract legal entity, it consists of a set of physical buildings, furnishings, etc.  By contrast, an organization that had no headquarters building, equipment, tangible property, etc. would not be an artifact.  Similarly, a fictional character such as Tom Sawyer is not an artifact (in the context of the story, Tom is not an artifact because he is a real boy; in the context of the real world, Tom is not an artifact because he has no tangible component whatsoever.)

While some artifacts may be alive, or contain living subparts, we do not intend this collection to encompass all organisms which resulted from normal biological reproductive processes.  Your child is not an artifact.

If you do an oil painting of a house that is an artifact, but much more borderline is what you get if you take a rock and just paint it a solid color, say white.  In general that won't be an artifact unless it serves some purpose, such as marking the shoulder of a roadway, but more questionable cases are if the purpose of the white rock is just `to be sold as art' or `to look pretty.'  The white rock might thus be an artifact in certain contexts, but not in others.

Not every instance of &%Path-Generic (q.v.) is necessarily an instance of &%Artifact.  For example, some channels used for navigation may not be artifacts, because even though they are marked with human artifacts (i.e., channel markers) as locations where ships may safely travel, the channel itself may have been a naturally occurring pre-existing thing -- e.g., the &%EnglishChannel.  If a &%ChannelOrStrait were produced or maintained only by constant dredging, it might count as an artifact.  By contrast, each &%Canal, such as &%SuezCanal, is almost certain to be an &%Artifact.  See also &%Product.")

(documentation primaryFunction "The predicate &%primaryFunction is used to indicate the primary use that is associated with some object. (&%primaryFunction OBJ SITTYPE ROLE) means that OBJ is primarily intended to participate in situations of the type SITTYPE in the role ROLE (see also &%intendedBehaviorCapable). 
Examples: the &%primaryFunction of an instance of &%MammographyFacility is to be the &%providerOfService in instances of &%MammographicBreastCancerScreening; the &%primaryFunction of a &%Pump-Mechanical is to be the &%providerOfMotiveForce in instances of &%ConveyingMaterials. Also included are non-&%Artifacts, for example an instance of &%Horse that is primarily used as a &%transporter in &%TransportationProcesss.
Note: Any existing thing can have multiple &%primaryFunctions, although in the &%SimpleDeviceFunctioningContext, it is assumed that every &%PhysicalDevice has only one primary function.")

(documentation relationInstanceExistsMany "(&%relationInstanceExistsMany SLOT INS1 COL2) means that for INS1 there are &%Many-Quant instances of COL2, INS2, such that (SLOT INS1 INS2) holds. Thus, (&%relationInstanceExistsMany &%anatomicalParts &%Muffet &%Hair-Strand) means simply `Muffet has a lot of hairs'.")

(documentation HumanActivitiesContext "The statements about actions in this context are true regardless of whether the action is performed by a person or by organizations of people.  If an assertion is only true for actions performed by individual persons, it should go in the &%IndividualHumanActivitiesContext or one of the mts for which it is base; if an assertion is only true for actions performed by organizations, it should go in the &%OrganizationContext or one of its related mts.  The &%HumanActivitiesContext also includes the assumption that the people are not innovative in the way they perform the actions (e.g. tools are used for their intended purpose and nothing else, so no one would unlock a door with a credit card).  This context assumes in addition that agents are rational, that they are aware of relevant aspects of their situation (e.g., aware of the capabilities they have for doing what they are doing), and that tools work the way they are supposed to.")

(documentation agent "The predicate &%performedBy relates an process to an agent who performs it deliberately, which in  means, intentionally and volitionally.  (&%performedBy ACT DOER) means that the agent DOER deliberately does the action ACT.  DOER must be an &%Agent.  For example, (&%performedBy &%AssassinationOfPresidentLincoln &%JohnWilkesBooth).  If ACT has multiple performers, ACT will be &%performedBy each of them.  See also &%deliberateActors, &%doneBy.")

(documentation relationAllExistsMany "(&%relationAllExistsMany SLOT COL1 COL2) means that for every instance of COL1 (INS1), there are &%Many-Quant instances of COL2 (INS2) such that (SLOT INS1 INS2) holds. Thus, (&%relationAllExistsMany &%anatomicalParts &%Dog &%Hair-Strand) means simply `Every dog has a lot of hairs'.")

(documentation CondensatePipeline "A collection of &%Pipelines; a subset of &%OilPipeline.  Each instance of &%CondensatePipeline is a pipeline  whose primary function is the transportation of portions of &%Petroleum-Condensate.")

(documentation industryFacilities "(&%industryFacilities INDUSTRY THING) means that THING is an inanimate object involved in carrying out the activities performed by INDUSTRY.  Examples: a factory, a field, a broadcasting tower, an oil well.")

(documentation groupMembers "The predicate &%groupMembers is used to relate a particular group to its individual members.  (&%groupMembers GROUP MEMBER) means that MEMBER is a member of GROUP.  For example,  the &%PyramidOfCheops is a member of the &%SevenWondersOfTheAncientWorld.  Or, to say that President Bill Clinton was a member of the Democratic Party throughout 1996, we would say: (&%holdsIn (&%YearFn 1996) (&%groupMembers &%DemocraticParty &%BillClinton)).")

(documentation IndustryFn "&%IndustryFn is a collection denoting function. (&%IndustryFn PRODUCT-TYPE) denotes the collection all of geographically defined industries (instances of &%Industry-Localized) that produce and/or sell (see &%sellsProductType) PRODUCT-TYPE.  See also &%IndustryOfRegionFn to denote the particular &%Industry-Localized characterized by being in a certain country and producing a certain kind of product.")

(documentation attribute "A very general predicate. (&%hasAttributes THING ATT) means that THING has the attribute ATT.  See also &%AttributeType and &%AttributeValue.")

(documentation IndustryOfRegionFn "(&%IndustryOfRegionFn INDUSTRY-TYPE REGION) is the &%Industry-Localized of type INDUSTRY-TYPE 'belonging to' REGION -- that is, its income contributes to the Gross National Product of the nation containing REGION.  If a private industry, it pays taxes to the national government of REGION. Not all of the industry's facilities are necessarily located in REGION.  For instance, it may have factories in countries where labor is cheaper.  See also &%IndustryFn which denotes types of industries characterized by what kind of products they create.")

(documentation outputsCreated "The predicate &%outputsCreated is used to identify items created by a particular process.  (&%outputsCreated PROCESS OBJECT) means that OBJECT doesn't exist before PROCESS but comes into existence sometime during PROCESS, as a result of PROCESS.  &%outputsCreated is a specialization of &%nonDeliberateActors, since it would in general be impossible for OBJECT to act deliberately in its own creation.")

(documentation makesProductType "The predicate &%makesProductType is used to indicate that a particular company makes a specific (i.e., type of) product.  (&%makesProductType ORG PRODTYP) means that the &%CommercialOrganization ORG manufactures the &%ProductType PRODTYP.  Cf. &%madeBy, &%mainProductType and &%soleProductType.")

(documentation industryProduces "(&%industryProduces INDUSTRY PRODUCT-SPEC) means that PRODUCT-SPEC is a type of product produced by the &%Industry-Localized INDUSTRY.")

(documentation transportees "The predicate &%transportees relates a translational motion process to the object(s) transported by another one of the &%actors in that process.  (&%transportees MOVE OBJ) means that some &%transporter facilitates the conveyance of OBJ in MOVE.  For example, in a dumptruck driving process, the dirt in the back of the truck is a &%transportees.  Any humans in the truck cab (or truck bed) during the trip are also &%transportees; however, a more precise role designation for humans riding in the truck would be either &%passengers or (for the driver) &%driverActor.  Borderline positive example &%transportees include the clothes worn by a person walking, or a horseshoe worn by a horse walking.  A negative exemplar of a &%transportees is the ear of the person walking.  This is because &%transporters do not transport their parts when they move.  Note also that parts of &%transportees are not necessarily &%transportees themselves.  See also the &%documentations on &%TransportationProcess and &%transporter.")

(documentation OffshoreGasPlatform "The collection of all off-shore platforms from which &%NaturalGas is collected. All instances of &%OffshoreGasPlatform are physical devices through which natural gas reservoirs are tapped. ")

(documentation actsInCapacity "The predicate &%actsInCapacity indicates the capacity in which an agent participates in certain kinds of actions.  (&%actsInCapacity AGENT ROLE SCRIPT-TYPE CAP) means that the agent AGENT plays the role ROLE in instances of SCRIPT-TYPE, and s/he does that role in the capacity CAP.  CAP is a &%CapacityAttribute (q.v.) which describes the AGENT's mode of participation--e.g., as a job, hobby, main function, support function, etc.  Contrast three cases of acts of &%GreetingSomeone, when &%performedBy: (1) instances of &%Receptionist, in their &%JobCapacity and as their &%MainFunction; (2) instances of &%FlightAttendant, in their &%JobCapacity but as a &%SupportFunction; and (3) instances of &%TrainEngineer, in a &%HobbyCapacity (though they do it while working, it's not part of their job).")

(documentation industryActivityTypes "(industryActivityTypes INDUSTRY ACTIVITY) means that ACTIVITY is one of the defining types of activities performed by members of an &%Industry-Localized INDUSTRY. For instance, a defining activity of any OilIndustry is &%ExtractingPetroleum, and a defining activity of any agriculture industry would be &%RaisingLivingThings.")

Specializations of the role &%transporter should be used when possible: although automobiles are &%transporters in many processs, they should normally have the more specific role designation of &%vehicle because they are also &%SelfPoweredDevices.
