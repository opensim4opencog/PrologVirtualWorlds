         (Starts-After-Starting-Of X Y) means (After (Start-Fn X) (Start-Fn Y)).  That is, the Starting-Point of X is later than the Starting-Point of Y.  This implies nothing about whether X and Y overlap, or how much they overlap, except that they can't be fully Cotemporal.

         (Object-Found-In-Location OBJ LOC) means that OBJ has the location LOC. OBJ is not a part of LOC.  Examples: the Arc-De-Triomphe is located in the City-Of-Paris-France; the Alaskan-Pipeline is found in Alaska-State; the Town-Of-Gettysburg-PA is located in the Eastern region of Pennsylvania (note that the town's territory is part of Pennsylvania, but the town as a social organization is distinct).  See also the :Documentation on In-Region.  Cf., for cases where OBJ is a spatial part of LOC, Physical-Decompositions, Geographical-Sub-Regions.

         The predicate From-Location is used to indicate the starting point of a particular movement.  (From-Location MOVE LOC) means that LOC is where the Object-Moving in the Movement-Translation-Event MOVE is found at the beginning of MOVE and is where it begins this motion.  The Object-Moving may or may not be Stationary at LOC.  If MOVE is a single-pathway translation (see Translation-Single-Path), then every Object-Moving is found at LOC when MOVE starts.  If MOVE has multiple movers and multiple pathways (see Translation-Multi-Path), then at least some of the Object-Moving(s) can be found at LOC at the start of MOVE.  If MOVE is a flow (including rivers flowing, winds blowing, tornado, typhoon, clouds moving and even air filling your lungs when you take breath, see Translation-Flow), then at least some portion of the fluid Object-Moving can be found at LOC at the start of MOVE.  See also Pathway-Complete, Path-Connects.

         (Positive-Vested-Interest AGT OBJ) means Agent AGT has a positive interest in the object OBJ or in the good fortune of OBJ.  Generally, AGT will be helped or pleased by the preservation or enhancement of OBJ.
Note:  the restriction of OBJ to Temporal-Thing means that it would be incorrect to use this predicate to say that Douglas Adams has a Positive-Vested-Interest in the number 42.  Rather, what he has a vested interest in is public popularity and faddism focusing on that number.  A fad is a Temporal-Thing, but the number 42 isn't.

         The predicate Object-Moving is used to refer to an object which is moving in a particular Movement-Event.  (Object-Moving MOVE OBJECT) means that OBJECT is in motion at some point during the Movement-Event MOVE and this movement is focal in MOVE.  In some cases, such as an instance of Locomotion-Event, OBJECT causes MOVE directly.  OBJECT's motion in MOVE may be translational, rotational, or some combination of these.  OBJECT may be a solid -- such as an animal, an automobile, or a tennis ball -- or a fluid, such as lava flowing or a warm air mass rising.

         This predicate relates, e.g., a sleigh-ride event to the sleigh being used to transport the people and goods.  (Transporter MOVE OBJ) means that OBJ enables or facilitates the conveyance of what is transported (the animals, goods, people, etc. that are the Transportees) in the Transportation-Event MOVE.  OBJ itself is an Object-Moving in MOVE, so a catapult is not a Transporter because it doesn't come with its victims.  OBJ will generally hold, support, contain, etc. the Transportees throughout the MOVE event.  OBJ may or may not supply the motive force in the event MOVE; e.g., a child's wagon, a bicycle, a sleigh, and a paper bag can all be Transporters.  More examples are automobiles, wheelchairs, dogsleds, and parachutes.  Carrier pigeons are transporters when performing the function for which they were bred; a horse is a Transporter when it is being ridden but a Provider-Of-Motive-Force when pulling a cart or plow or sleigh.Some cautions and refinements, however: (i) although automobiles are Transporters, they should have the more specific role designation of Vehicle (q.v.) because they are also Self-Powered-Devices.   When your car is being towed by a towtruck, and you are riding along inside as it gets towed, then in that special case the car is just a Transporter (of you) and the towtruck is the Vehicle of that event.  (ii) Another more specific role designation for some Transporters -- those which are Physical-Devices -- is Device-Used (q.v.); e.g., the use of crutches in hobbling, ice skates in skating, and sneakers in walking.  See also the :Documentation on Transportation-Event.  (iii) The organism locomoting in a Locomotion-Event may be a Transporter if carrying something other than itself (Carrying-While-Locomoting qv.) .  In other cases an organism may be a Transportees, e.g. someone riding a bike or skating.  Note that the organism must be the Provider-Of-Motive-Force in these cases.

         (Goals AGT G) means that the Agent AGT has the Goal G.  That is, G is one of their goals.  This implies (Desires AGT G), but Goals is stronger than Desires, in that an agent will take action (or at least intend to take action, and plan accordingly) to make their Goals true, while their Desires may include things s/he merely wishes were true, but about which s/he has no intention of undertaking action.  Additionally, Goals are generally about the future, whereas Desires can be about the present, future, or even the past.  For further information about goals, see Goal.  Also see Intends.

         The predicate Exchangers is used to identify the (typically, two) Agents involved in an instance of Exchange-Of-User-Rights.   In such an event, each of the Exchangers gives up possession of one thing and gains possession of another which was previously possessed by the other agent.  (Exchangers EXCH AGENT) means that AGENT is one of the parties having such a dual role in the Exchange-Of-User-Rights EXCH.  Every instance of Exchange-Of-User-Rights has two sub-events which are instances of Transferring-Possession (e.g., a dollar bill goes in one direction and some french fries and a few coins go in the other direction.)  Each of the Exchangers is both a To-Possessor (in one of the two Transferring-Possession sub-events of EXCH) and a From-Possessor (in the other sub-event).

Subattribute-Of is transitive, so (Subattribute-Of A B) and (Subattribute-Of B C) lets the system derive (Subattribute-Of A C).

         The predicate Sub-Organizations relates a particular organization to
one of its sub-organizations. (Sub-Organizations ORG1 ORG2) means ORG2 is a
 sub-organization of ORG1, whether it is at the very next organizational level
down, e.g., (Sub-Organizations NationalLeague-Baseball NationalLeagueEast-Baseball),
or several levels down the heirarchy, e.g., (Sub-Organizations NationalLeague-Baseball NewYorkMets).

         The predicate Has-Ownership-In relates a particular agent to some thing of which it has part or whole ownership.  (Has-Ownership-In AGENT SOMETHING) means that the Agent AGENT owns a part (or possibly the whole) of the thing SOMETHING.  For example, Ted Turner Has-Ownership-In Atlanta's Olympic Stadium. There may be other owners.  See also Legal-Owner-Of and Owns-Share.

         (Owns AGENT OBJECT) means that AGENT owns OBJECT -- that is, AGENT enjoys Full-Use-Rights (q.v.) over OBJECT.  
Note:  There are commonsense rules relating Owns to Controls.  E.g., ownership typically implies control.  But they are just default rules, as there are many exceptions (e.g., when the owner of a building leases it to a company for ten years, the owner gives up almost all `control' over it during that decade).

         (Deliberate-Actors ACT ACTR) means that the Agent ACTR is conscious, volitional, purposeful in the event ACT.   ACTR is aware of acting in ACT and chooses to play the role he/she/it has in that event; i.e., ACTR has some purpose in mind.
Note:  If you do something deliberately but you fail, you are still a Deliberate-Actors.  For instance, you are a near-sighted doer of Showing-Support-For-Someone at a fencing match, and it turns out you were cheering for Fred when you thought you were cheering for Joe; nevertheless, you are still one of the Deliberate-Actors in the Showing-Support-For-Someone event.
Note: Legal responsibility is a separte issue from `deliberateness.'  Doing something in a fit of rage (e.g. a crime of passion) still involves purpose, volition, and consciousness even if considered for only an instant, and even if the laws and courts find you not guilty.

(Information-Destination TRANSFER DEST) means that in the Information-Transfer-Event TRANSFER, the information being transferred is sent, given to, or impressed upon DEST.  DEST is an IBT (i.e., an element of Information-Bearing-Thing) or an agent.  Note that if DEST is an agent, you should probably use the more specific actor slot, Recipient-Of-Info.  Note also that if DEST existed before the transfer, it may have already contained the information.

         (Subcontext-Of SMT GMT) means Microtheory SMT is a specialization of Microtheory GMT.   E.g., (Subcontext-Of Modern-Military-Mt Organization-Mt), which means that all the assertions which are true `content' in the general Organization-Mt context are also true in the more specialized Modern-Military-Mt context.  Another way to think of this is that SMT `has access to' the content of GMT.   Each proposition which is true in GMT is also true in SMT.  The Subcontext-Of relation is transitive; it induces a partial ordering on the set of all microtheories.   

Each assertion in the knowledge base must be explicitly stated to be true in at least one mt.  It will then (by inference) also be true in all the more specialized contexts.  If something is true in the `life in North America' mt, then it should by default be true in the `life in Canada' mt.  I.e., the microtheories are organized into a generalization/specialization lattice by the predicate Subcontext-Of, just as collections are organized into such a lattice by :Direct-Superclasses, and just as predicates are organized into such a lattice by Subrelation-Of.  Just as a collection may have several incommensurable supersets, so too a microtheory may have several incommensurable Genl-Mts.  Just as each and every collection must have some explicitly recorded superset (except for Thing), each and every mt must have some (expicitly recorded) more general mt (except for the Base-KB, which is the most general context, containing universal, timeless truths).  Just as a Cyc concept may have multiple incommensurable sets of which it is an element (via :Direct-Types), so too a Cyc assertion may be declared to be true in a set of incommensurable mts.  For virtually all intents and purposes, Subcontext-Of assertions should go in Base-KB.

         (Vehicle EVENT VEHICLE) means that VEHICLE is a Transportation-Device-Vehicle which is both the Provider-Of-Motive-Force and the Transporter in EVENT.  If an object is a Transportation-Device-Vehicle and plays the role of Transporter in some moving event, then it generally  will play the role of Vehicle in that event.  Examples: a car plays the role of Vehicle in driving.  Note, however, that a bicycle does not play the role of Vehicle in bike riding since it is not a provider of motive force.  A borderline non-example is someone sitting in their car while it's being pulled by a towtruck; their car is not playing the role of Vehicle in that event.

         (Directing-Agent ACT AGENT) means that AGENT is one of the agents that is in control of or directing ACT, but not necessarily directly performing it.  If, in the event ACT, an agent other than AGENT has the Performed-By role, then that performer's actions in ACT are directed by AGENT.  For example, (Directing-Agent PSOBicentennialConcertOfBeethovensNinth #WilliamSteinberg) is true, because Steinberg was the conductor of that concert; he directed the many other musicians who performed in that event.  Another case: (Directing-Agent MassacreAtMyLai LtWilliamCalley).  The type of direction implied by Directing-Agent is the kind that can be accomplished by AGENT communicating its desires to the actual performer(s) of ACT.  So, a person would be the Directing-Agent in a clothes-washing event Done-By a washing machine ONLY in those contexts in which we can consider the machine an agent, acting intentionally.

         The predicate Outputs-Created is used to identify items created by a particular event.  (Outputs-Created EVENT OBJECT) means that OBJECT doesn't exist before EVENT but comes into existence sometime during EVENT, as a result of EVENT.  Outputs-Created is a specialization of Non-Deliberate-Actors, since it would in general be impossible for OBJECT to act deliberately in its own creation.

         (Controls X Y) represents that assertion that agent X controls the object Y, in one of the following 2 senses:  X can influence (prohibit, enable or constrain) the behavior of Y; or else X can at least influence (prohibit, enable or constrain) the behavior of other Agents in/concerning Y.  For example, Fred may control his horse directly, forcing it to do things, or not do them; and he also could control the horse indirectly, by deciding who else has access to and use of that horse.  Control of one agent over another agent is rarely total, of course, so this predicate is most likely to apply to a Y which is a non-living possession, and/or to apply in a very narrow context.  X's control over Y is usually either actual (de facto) control or legal (de jure) control.  It is usually Cotemporal, meaning that some time slice of X controls the same temporal time slice of Y.

The predicate Sub-Events can be used to decompose events in time, in space, and/or in other ways.  Following a recipe often has this property:  the task is broken down into several sub-tasks, some of which happen before others, and some of which happen simultaneously but involve different ingredients.  One could also decompose `making dinner' into Sub-Events according to how dangerous they are, which might be useful if one had kids of various ages helping.  Often, a more specialized relation than Sub-Events can be used; e.g., if you have subevents that decompose an action in time only, then the more specialized predicate Sub-Processes should be used.

Note that those two types of cases should be distinguished by using (respectively) the specialized predicates Outputs-Created or Outputs-Remaining whenever they are appropriate, rather than only the more general predicate Outputs.

         The predicate Done-By relates an event to its `doer'.  (Done-By EVENT DOER) means that DOER is the `doer' in the event EVENT.  Some action on the part of the doer causes or carries out the event.  This predicate is agnostic as to whether DOER does EVENT intentionally or not (DOER need not even be animate; e.g., the event in which Mount Vesuvius erupted and buried Pompeii was Done-By Mount Vesuvius).  See Performed-By and Bodily-Doer for the more specific senses of `doer' when DOER is, respectively, an agent (Agent) acting deliberately or a biological organism (Organism-Whole).

         (Duration ?X ?Y) means that ?Y is length of time Temporal-Thing ?X happened/existed.  For a continuous Temporal-Thing, this is the same as its Measure (the elapsed time from start to end.)  But for a discontinuous Temporal-Thing, the Duration is strictly less than the Measure.  For example, the Duration of `the Mondays during May of 1996' is (Days-Duration 4), whereas the Measure of that same temporal object is (Days-Duration 22).
Note:  Unfortunately, in some disciplines, such as Real Analysis, these two terms' definitions are switched!  In such contexts, one could assert to Cyc that the preferred denotation of Duration was Measure-The-Word, and that the preferred denotation of Measure was Duration-The-Word, but notice that the two concepts --- Measure and Duration --- are still distinct and useful in that discipline, they just happen to have different names there.

         The predicate Device-Used indicates that a particular device is used in a particular event. (Device-Used EVENT OBJECT) means that the Physical-Device OBJECT plays an instrumental role in the Event EVENT.  (See also Instrument-Generic.) OBJECT is intentionally used in EVENT, and standardly (e.g., in the Human-Activities-Mt) OBJECT's role in EVENT is consistent with the object's Primary-Function.

         (Temporal-Bounds-Contain LONGER SHORTER) means that LONGER strictly contains SHORTER.  There is a positive non-zero time after LONGER starts before SHORTER starts, and there is a positive non-zero time after SHORTER ends before LONGER ends.   That is, the Starting-Point of LONGER is a finite amount of time earlier than the Starting-Point of SHORTER, and the Ending-Point of LONGER is a finite amount of time later than the Ending-Point of SHORTER.   Naturally, Temporal-Bounds-Contain is a stronger relation than Temporal-Bounds-Intersect.  If LONGER is Temporally-Continuous, then (Temporal-Bounds-Contain LONGER SHORTER) further implies (Temporally-Subsumes LONGER SHORTER).  Note:  This Cyc temporal relation is equivalent to what James Allen independently dubbed the CONTAINS relation.

      <rdfs:comment>
         The predicate Object-Acted-On is used to relate an event to an entity (or entities) significantly affected in that event.  That entity must exist before the event, but may be either destroyed in the event (see Inputs-Destroyed), or merely affected by it (e.g., see Damages, Object-Of-State-Change). (Object-Acted-On EVENT OBJECT) means that OBJECT is altered or affected in EVENT, and the change that OBJECT undergoes is central or focal to understanding EVENT.  Thus, scissors are NOT an Object-Acted-On in a Hair-Cutting-Event.  The focal change in a haircut is hair getting shorter; thus, hair is a legitimate Object-Acted-On in a Hair-Cutting-Event.  The almost microscopic dulling that scissors undergo in a single haircut is a comparatively insignificant change with respect to a single haircut, considered as a Hair-Cutting-Event.  

Note: long-term effects of usage on devices should be axiomatized in connection with Using-A-Fn constants.

         (Provider-Of-Motive-Force ACT OBJ) means that OBJ provides, through its expenditure of energy, a significant fraction of the physical force required to make ACT happen. For example, if ACT is an element of Pedaling-A-Bicycle, OBJ will be the person who is operating the bike.  Another example: in the use of a belt sanding tool, there will be two values for Provider-Of-Motive-Force, the electric sander and the person operating the sander.  In that case, although force is transmitted and applied through the sandpaper, the paper doesn't count as a Provider-Of-Motive-Force, because it only transmits force and does not itself expend energy.   Note that inferences involving this constant require that every Provider-Of-Motive-Force be a whole object, not just a part of an object.  For example: (=&gt; (:and (:Direct-Types ?LOCO Locomotion-Event) (Provider-Of-Motive-Force ?LOCO ?OBJ)) (Object-Moving ?LOCO ?OBJ)) or (=&gt; (:and (:Direct-Types ?LOC Locomotion-Event) (Provider-Of-Motive-Force ?LOC ?PROV)) (Done-By ?LOC ?PROV)) or (Domain-Assumptions Manual-Human-Activities-Mt (:Forall ?U (:Forall ?PERS (:=&gt; (:and (:Direct-Types ?U Action) (Provider-Of-Motive-Force ?U ?PERS)) (:Direct-Types ?PERS Person)))))).

Note, regarding whether OBJECT is a part of AREA: Two subordinate, but contrasting, predicates are Physical-Decompositions (a :Slot-Inverse of In-Region) and Object-Found-In-Location (a Subrelation-Of of In-Region).  (1) OBJECT is a Physical-Decompositions of AREA if the set of points occupied by OBJECT is a subset of the points actually occupied by AREA; i.e., OBJECT is spatially a part of AREA.  (2) On the other hand, if OBJECT is merely present in AREA, but is not a part of it, then Object-Found-In-Location applies.

         (Between THIS THAT MID-OBJ) means that MID-OBJ is spatially directly between THIS and THAT.  Depending on the context, MID-OBJ may lie on a great circle between THIS and THAT, or on a true Euclidian straight line between them.  Note that Between applies only to physical location.  To describe a relationship involving numbers or Scalar-Intervals, use Greater-Than or Following-Value.  To describe a 'between' relationship along some particular physical path (like: Austin is between Dallas and San Antonio on Highway I-35), or on some trajectory, see Between-On-Path.

         The predicate Agreement-Forbids is used to indicate types of actions that a particular agent is forbidden from performing under the terms of a particular agreement.  (Agreement-Forbids AGR AGENT ACT-TYPE) means that the Agreement AGR forbids the Agent AGENT from ACT-TYPE activities.  For example, an instance of Peace-Accord Agreement-Forbids the governments who signed it from Waging-War against one another; or, a business contract may forbid one agent from competing with another after s/he sells rights to a product, design, or practice to the second agent.

         (Border-Between-Fn REG1 REG2), applied to two individual Geographical-Regions REG1 REG2, returns the unique entire Geopolitical-Border that separates them.   To identify arbitrarily large or small segments of borders see Forms-Border-Part.  The border returned by Border-Between-Fn may be discontinuous (such the border between France and Spain, interrupted by Andorra), or circular (such as the border between Italy and San Marino), or in abnormal cases it may even have multiple disconnected and nested cyclic fragments (the border between Belgium and Netherlands, due to the Baarle-Nassau and Baarle-Hartog enclaves), or move back and forth periodically (such as at the Isle des Faisans).  Nonetheless, (Border-Between-Fn REG1 REG2) must denote exactly one object since Border-Between-Fn is a function.  Reference to nonexistant borders such (Border-Between-Fn Albania United-States-Of-America) should cause Cyc to realize that they are undefined.  For example, if Cyc concludes that (Borders-On United-States-Of-America Albania) is not true, then it should conclude (Undefined (Border-Between-Fn Albania United-States-Of-America)).

         (STIF ?X) returns the `Short Time Interval Following' ?X.  The function STIF is used to state axioms which assert propositions about the world just after some Temporal-Thing (i.e., after an event ends, after a tangible object ceases to exist, etc.).  Each of those propositions may or may not hold beyond the bounds of that short interval.  Consider the axiom `after swimming, the swimmer is wet'. The swimmer is only known to be wet for a short time interval immediately following the swimming event, and so we use STIF to specify that short time interval in which the assertion of wetness will hold.  Beyond that time, additional axioms would be required to decide whether the wetness would persist or not.  Also see: STIB.

Both X and Y have to be on PATH (see Point-On-Path).  Note that (Path-Between PATH X Y) is more specific than (Path-Connects PATH X Y) because here the PATH cannot extend beyond X and Y.  Within a particular Path-System, a path's end points in the system are unique, and Path-Between-In-System is restricted to paths and points in the system.  When considered without a context of a path system, a path may have several different places at one end, such as Austin and Texas both being at the same end of some path along Highway I-35.

         The predicate Behavior-Capable is used to describe a type of situation (and the role) in which an object can participate due to its intrinsic properties.

Primary-Function, Intended-Behavior-Capable).  Also, Behavior-Capable does not imply that OBJ can unquestionably act in that way in every such situation, since extrinsic factors may prevent it; e.g., the object may be in the wrong location, operated by a person lacking the proper skills, certain legal preconditions may not be satisfied, etc.  Examples: (intended capability) a hammer is Behavior-Capable of being the Device-Used in instances of Hammering-A-Nail; (unintended capability) an inner tube is capable of being the Device-Used in instances of people Floating-In-Liquid.

Note that X and Y should rarely be instances of Entity.  In fact, Doug has only been acqainted with Madonna since 1983, so we should write (Holds-In (Time-Interval-From-Fn (Year-Fn 1983) Now) (Acquaintances Lenat Madonna True-Fan-Acquaintance)).

For example, the value of (Meaning-In-System-Fn Word-Net-Information ''N221566'') is the concept (or WordNet `synset') represented by the synonyms (rampart|bulwark|wall), meaning 'an embankment built around a space for defensive purposes' in the WordNet system.  The STRING can have any format chosen by the person who builds the representation of the external system; usually it will include some index string that is used as an identifier in the external system.  In addition, the STRING may arbitrarily contain any further characters or information, depending on how the external information is selected and processed.  This function allows you to relate a concept in an external system to an arbitrarily complicated expression composed of Cyc concepts.  If the external concept has a direct, exact mapping to a single Cyc constant, then it is better to use the predicate Synonymous-External-Concept rather than this function.  If the there is a direct correspondence to one Cyc constant, but it is only an approximate correspondence of meaning, you can use Overlapping-External-Concept.

         The predicate Intended-Behavior-Capable is used to describe ways in which an object was designed to function.  (Intended-Behavior-Capable OBJ SITTYPE ROLE) means that the individual, OBJ, was designed to serve as a ROLE in situations or events of type SITTYPE.  For example, a Land-Transportation-Device such as an automobile is intended to serve the Vehicle role in instances of (Transport-Via-Fn Land-Transportation-Device); an element of Sphygmomanometer is intended to serve as the Device-Used in instances of Systolic-Blood-Pressure-Test; an element of Rest-Area is intended to be where a Resting-Relaxing Event-Occurs-At.  A thing may be able to play the same kind of ROLE in different kinds of situations; e.g., an element of Stove-Top-Cooking-Pot can be the Instrument-Container in either Boiling-Food or Steaming-Food events.  Or something may serve more than one function; e.g., a Vacuum-Cleaner serves both as the Device-Used in instances of Vacuuming and (in virtue of its Vacuum-Dust-Bag) as the Instrument-Container.

         (STIB ?X) returns the `Short Time Interval Before' ?X.  The function STIB is used to state axioms which assert propositions about the world just before some Temporal-Thing.  E.g., just before some event begins, or just before some tangible object comes into being.  Whether the propositions hold beyond the bounds of the short interval specified depends the nature of the proposition.  Consider the axiom `before launching, the Space Shuttle's fuel tanks are full'. The fuel tanks are only known to be full immediately before the launching event, and for some (measurable but potentially short) time interval before that launch, and so we use STIB to specify the time interval in which the assertion of fullness will hold.  Before or after that time, additional axioms are required to conclude whether the tanks are full or not.  Also see:  STIF.

         Body-Part-Collection-Fn is a Collection-Denoting-Function, that is, it is a Cyc function which `returns' (i.e., `has') a collection as its value.  Here is an example of what it does.  The expression (Body-Part-Collection-Fn Abraham-Lincoln Fingernail) returns, as its value, a collection of ten elements, each of which represents one of the fingernails of Abraham Lincoln.  In cases where an animal is likely to only have one part of that type (e.g., head, heart, nose, nervous system), it makes more sense to use the function Body-Part-Fn (qv), rather than using this one, getting a singleton set back, and extracting its lone element.

A noteworthy class of exceptions is Courtesy-Title (q.v.), which include forms of address such as `Mr.' and `Ms.', plus some titles which by courtesy the holders retain for life, such as (in the U.S.) `President' and military rank designations (e.g., officers retired from the armed services).

         The predicate Anatomically-Capable-Of indicates that an agent is anatomically able to take a certain role in a certain type of situation or event.  (Anatomically-Capable-Of AGENT SIT-TYPE ROLE) means that an individual Animal AGENT has the anatomical prerequisites (natural or prosthetic) to act in this ROLE in normal instances of SIT-TYPE.  For example, to express that Karen is capable of walking, Cyc would say (Anatomically-Capable-Of Karen Biped-Walking Performed-By).  AGENT may or may not have the skills (or other prerequisites) for actually doing a SIT-TYPE.  Anatomically-Capable-Of entails that AGENT satisfies the relevant Anatomical-Resource-Required constraint--e.g., for Karen's Biped-Walking, that she has two legs (natural or prosthetic).  As a default, Cyc concludes that animals who have the Anatomical-Parts needed for a certain kind of activity are Anatomically-Capable-Of that activity--for example, that people who have arms and legs are Anatomically-Capable-Of swimming; those conclusions would be overridden by the additional information that a person was paralyzed.

         (Feels-Sensation BLO SENSTYPE DEGREE) means that the Biological-Living-Object BLO feels a sensation of type SENSTYPE with the intensity DEGREE.  Feels-Sensation may be used to describe an organism's feeling during a particular time period or activity (see Holds-In); for example, we might say of a particular person who is doing yoga: (Holds-In `TodaysYoga' (Feels-Sensation Prakriti Level-Of-Relaxation-Feeling Very-High).  Note that the first argument of Feels-Sensation could also be filled by a part of an organism, e.g., `John F. Kennedy's head'; however, by using the more specialized predicate Feels-Response-On-Body-Region (q.v.), we can express localized feelings without reifying each such region.

Each instance of Metal-Alloy is a metallic stuff which is a homogeneous blend of at least one part of Unalloyed-Metal with at least one other substance.  Metal-Alloy is not a subset of Mixture, because each instance of Metal-Alloy is defined not only by the amounts and kinds of its Constituents, but also (unlike a mixture) by the internal structures formed during its creation.  Furthermore, the creation process is typically more complex than Mixing.  Common metal alloys include the instances of Bronze, Brass, and Steel.  Note that Galvanized-Metal is NOT a subset of Metal-Alloy, because every instance of Galvanized-Metal has a coating of some Zinc on its surface, and thus (unlike an alloy) the components of galvanized metals are not homogenously distributed throughout.

         A collection of collections; Organism-Classification-Type is the collection of all biological types used to classify animals, plants, or other elements of Organism-Whole.  The scientific types in Organism-Classification-Type may or may not correspond to naive categories of organisms, and, in addition, although they are scientific, they might not be officially accepted biological taxons at the standard taxonomic levels.  (Invertebrate is an example.)  Compare Biological-Taxon-Type.







Note that Organism-Classification-Type is an element of Sibling-Disjoint-Collection; hence, any two instances of Organism-Classification-Type can be assumed to be disjoint, unless we know that one is a subset of the other (also see Sibling-Disjoint-Collection).

      </Name-In-Cyc>
      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of tangible things.  An instance of Artifact is a tangible which was more or less intentionally created by an Agent (or a group of Agents working together) to serve some purpose or perform some function.  By `created', we don't require that the matter itself be created, it is often just the result of some sort of assemblage or modification process, such as a wooden flute that's been whittled from a tree branch, a sawhorse that's been put together out of boards and nails, a coin that's been minted by embossing or by melting liquid silver into a mold, etc.

Let's consider some positive and negative examples.

In addition to the obvious human artifacts (buildings, tools, textiles, power lines), this collection includes certain sorts of things made by Animals, such as bird nests, termite mounds, and beaver dams.

Something which just barely squeaks through the intended meaning of this concept is Yale-University.  In addition to the abstract legal entity, it consists of a set of physical buildings, furnishings, etc.  By contrast, an organization that had no headquarters building, equipment, tangible property, etc. would not be an artifact.  Similarly, a fictional character such as Tom Sawyer is not an artifact (in the context of the story, Tom is not an artifact because he is a real boy; in the context of the real world, Tom is not an artifact because he has no tangible component whatsoever.)

While some artifacts may be alive, or contain living subparts, we do not intend this collection to encompass all organisms which resulted from normal biological reproductive processes.  Your child is not an artifact.

If you do an oil painting of a house that is an artifact, but much more borderline is what you get if you take a rock and just paint it a solid color, say white.  In general that won't be an artifact unless it serves some purpose, such as marking the shoulder of a roadway, but more questionable cases are if the purpose of the white rock is just `to be sold as art' or `to look pretty.'  The white rock might thus be an artifact in certain contexts, but not in others.

Not every instance of Path-Generic (q.v.) is necessarily an instance of Artifact.  For example, some channels used for navigation may not be artifacts, because even though they are marked with human artifacts (i.e., channel markers) as locations where ships may safely travel, the channel itself may have been a naturally occurring pre-existing thing -- e.g., the English-Channel.  If a Channel-Wide-Strait were produced or maintained only by constant dredging, it might count as an artifact.  By contrast, each Canal, such as Suez-Canal, is almost certain to be an Artifact.

         The collection of drinkable substances; a collection of edible stuff and a subset of Food-And-Drink.  Each element of the collection Drink is a liquid of a type that is ingestible and commonly consumed by humans or animals.  Drinks are ingested without chewing.  Examples of Drink include all elements of the collections Water-Ingestible, Tea-Hot, Hot-Chocolate, Lemonade, Beer. .  By default they are liquids.  Borderline examples include a thick milkshake or soup, even if there are solid objects suspended in it.  Thus Liquid-Tangible-Thing is not necessarily (monotonically) a :Direct-Superclasses of Drink, though it is true by default that a Drink be an instance of Liquid-Tangible-Thing.  I.e., by default, elements of Drink are in a Liquid-State-Of-Matter.  Another borderline example of a Drink is a glassful of poison or urine; it may be unpalatable or unsafe to drink a Drink.  Note that the Drink includes the portion of liquid, but not the container such as the glass or coffee cup or bowl.   So one borderline non-example is a glass of water -- as opposed to a glassful of water; the former includes the glass, the latter doesn't.   Other borderline non-examples include: an ice cube, a grape sno-cone, a scoop of ice cream with hot fudge sauce on it, and a tiny bit of liquid such as a single raindrop even if it enters one's mouth.

Note that the expiring animal is related to its dying event by Bodily-Doer (q.v.)--in contrast to the role an organism plays when it is the Object-Acted-On in a Killing-Biological event (which will have some Dying event among its Sub-Events), and cf.

      <rdfs:comment>
         Skolem-Function is a collection of Cyc system-generated functions that implement existential quantifications in Cyc.  Whenever someone asserts to Cyc an expression that contains a `:Exists', Cyc automatically creates a new element of Skolem-Function and rewrites the assertion using that skolem function, as described in what follows.  (Most Cyc users don't need to know the following details, which are supplied only for the curious.)







Suppose we tell Cyc that every animal has a birth date; i.e., for each animal, there exists a date such that the animal was born on that date --- in CycL, (:=&gt; (:Direct-Types ?x Animal)(:Exists ?y (Birth-Date ?x ?y))).  In response to that CycL formula, Cyc would create a new element of Skolem-Function -- we might call it the `BirthDateFn' -- whose single argument would be an animal and whose resultant value would be a date, namely, that animal's date of birth.  Subsequently, Cyc would automatically use the `BirthDateFn' in asserting our rule, eliminating the need for a `:Exists'.  Our formula would thus be rewritten by the system, as follows:







(:=&gt; 

   (:and

     (:Direct-Types ?x Animal)

     (Term-Of-Unit ?y (`BirthDateFn' ?x)))

   (Birth-Date ?x ?y)).





See also Term-Of-Unit. 





Note: Although our example uses the name 'BirthDateFn' for our skolem function, at this time (4/97), skolem functions are automatically named by the Cyc system using the prefix `SKF-' followed by a number.  The system-generated name can be replaced by re-naming, though that is rarely done in practice.

      <rdfs:comment>
         Movement-Event is the most general collection of events which are physical movements.  Each element of Movement-Event is an action primarily about some element(s) of Partially-Tangible rotating or translating, periodically or nonperiodically, with respect to some frame of reference which is not a part of the Object-Moving.  Thus, Neil Armstrong stepping from the lunar landing module onto the Moon's surface is an instance of Movement-Event.  Another element of this collection: the turning of the Earth on its axis 31 times during the month of August 1996.  Li Xiaoshuang's compulsory floor exercise in the 1996 Olympics Men's Gymnastics Team Competition is also a (complex!) movement event.  















Note on what is NOT included in this concept:  Consider a person raising her hand and waving, or a tree whose branches are bending in a strong wind:  the person and the tree are remaining in the same place, so that person and that tree are not moving in the sense of Movement-Event (though the hand and the branches are).  In other words, `performers' which do not, as a whole, rotate or translate are not Actors in any element of Movement-Event.  However, the waving person and tree events would have Sub-Events which DO belong to Movement-Event, in which a hand, a branch, etc., `moves' in this sense.  Note also that elements of Transformation-Event, such as a caterpillar turning into a butterfly, or of Shaping-Something, such as molding a piece of clay into the bust of Napoleon, are also not necessarily elements of this collection, because they do not involve motion of the whole object with respect to some frame of reference that is different from the object's.  (See also Frame-Of-Reference.)















Note: When classifying something into Movement-Event, one should consider (1) is it translational or rotational motion?  (2) is it periodic or nonperiodic?  (3) does it involve a continuous flow or a discrete (an object or objects moving completely from one place to another) motion? (4) does it involve a location change or no location change? (5) does it involve a single pathway or more than one?  Based on the answers to those questions, one or more of these subsets of Movement-Event may more precisely represent the moving: Movement-Translation-Event, Movement-Rotation, Movement-Periodic, Movement-Non-Periodic, Translation-Flow, Translation-Complete, Translation-Single-Path, Translation-Multi-Path.

Like anything else that has at least some tangible component, each element of Composite-Tangible-And-Intangible-Object exists in time.  Our representation allows us to separately reify the tangible and intangible components of an object; this is sometimes necessary  (e.g., to state that the age of the Frankenstein monster's mind is x, the age of his body is y, and the age of the new composite is z) but not very often needed --- usually one can just reify the Composite-Tangible-And-Intangible-Object and state things about it.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of binary predicates (i.e., slots).  Flexibility in the representation of quantities is allowed in assertions made with the binary predicates that are elements of Interval-Based-Quantity-Slot.  Each of these predicates, like those in their superset Quantity-Slot, is a binary predicate whose second argument must be an element of Scalar-Interval, i.e., an interval or point representing the value of some measurement.  For example, take the predicate Height-Of-Object, which relates an object to its vertical length.  Although we suppose that in reality there is only a single distance that is the height of some one particular object, our measurement systems are in practice less precise--and typically we need a measurement only within a certain tolerance.  For example, in measuring the Height-Of-Object of a person, usually a measurement to the nearest inch or centimeter will do.  Or we may be even less detailed in our descriptions, perhaps caring only whether someone is more than four feet tall, or `Tall enough to ride' on an amusement park ride.  By allowing an Interval-Entry Format (qq.v.) in the second argument of the measuring predicate, we are telling Cyc that it's okay to describe the (e.g.) Height-Of-Object in several different ways, with varying levels of precision, SO LONG AS all of the measurements asserted for the same object `overlap'.  For example, it is consistent to say both that Jenny is 4'10'' tall, between four and five feet tall, and that she is `Tall enough to ride' the Dodgems (provided that `Tall enough to ride' is an interval whose minimum is at 4'10'' or lower).  Even though there is only one height of a person in reality, using an Interval-Based-Quantity-Slot allows us to represent that height in many different ways, avoiding contradictions while still checking for consistency.  For example, asserting both that Jeff's Height-Of-Object is 5'9'' and in the range 4.5-5.5 feet tall is an inconsistency.

If a proposal is accepted by all parties, they all then become Agreeing-Agents in an agreement based on that proposal.  For example, an instance of Bid-On-Sale states the terms at which a potential seller will supply goods to the agent who requested bids.  If a particular seller's bid is accepted, then some instance of Sales-Contract is drawn up to which both parties agree; it includes the terms of the bid, along with any additions such as information about how or when the buyer will pay.

         Intolerance of rivalry; feeling of suspicion and resentment of one's rivals.  This is a collection; for an explanation of a typical Feeling-Attribute-Type, see Happiness.
Note: Envy is related to covetousness, wanting (perhaps in the future) what someone else has; Jealousy is related to possessiveness, wanting to keep what is (or was or could have been) already yours.

For example, the K-Mart-Store at Parmer Lane, Simon &amp; David at the Arboretum, and Great Hills Fire-Station Number 2 would be positive instances.  But the K-Mart-Company, Tom-Thumb-The-Company, and the Austin City Fire Department are negative examples, since those `parent' organizations have several sites as their Physical-Quarters.

         A collection of events.  In an instance of Exchange-Of-User-Rights, two Agents (the Exchangers) perform two distinct (though related) Transferring-Possessions with each other.  Two objects are exchanged.  Each agent gains possession -- in the form of some User-Rights-Attribute -- of something (an Object-Of-Possession-Transfer) from the other.  Each transfer is related to the other as some kind of condition, a precondition or an intended result; e.g., the news seller will hand over a paper if given fifty cents, and I give the news seller my fifty cents so that he will turn over a newspaper to me.  The two Transferring-Possession events are Sub-Events of the Exchange-Of-User-Rights event.

         A collection of Cyc functions; a subset of Individual-Denoting-Function.  Each element of Generic-Value-Function is a function that can be applied to an element of Primitive-Attribute-Type and returns some `generic' amount (e.g., high, medium, low) of that attribute.  Such functions are particularly useful for qualitative, hard-to-quantify attribute types, e.g., Happiness, Fragility, Absorbency, Glamor, etc.  They save us from having to create individually the various levels of attributes like Happiness, Fragility, etc.  Instead, for example, we need only refer to (High-Amount-Fn Happiness) as an alternative to painstakingly reifying `HighHappiness' and hand-entering all the formulas that such a constant requires (e.g. :Direct-Types, Following-Value, etc.). The compositionality afforded by the elements of Generic-Value-Function allows this overhead to be taken care of automatically.

         The collection of acts of IBO-Creation
done by an Animal (including Person) arranging its limbs or other
body parts (and whatever objects the limbs might be holding) in some
meaningful configuration (static or dynamic).  Vocal IBT-Generations
are not considered to be gestures (see Making-An-Oral-Sound for this),
but they might be done in conjunction with gestures.
NB:  Making-A-Gesture is NOT a subset of Non-Verbal-Communicating;
at most, an instance of Making-A-Gesture is only half of a communication event.
And someone can make a gesture while alone, without using it for
communication. Thus, only some gestures are Sub-Events of
Non-Verbal-Communicating. (But note that Making-A-Gesture IS a subset
of IBT-Generation-Original (q.v.), since every gesture encodes
information, whether or not it is used for communication in a
particular instance.)

In some species, the migration cycle occurs once in a lifetime, while others migrate annually on a seasonal basis.   Migration is typically linked with an animal's reproductive cycle (as in salmon), but may also involve seasonal relocation to a more hospitable climate and/or more plentiful food supply. For example, many birds exhibit seasonal migration; e.g., native Northeastern U.S. birds that spend their winters in the Southern U.S.

         A collection of events.  Each element of Change-In-User-Rights is an event in which some instance of Agent either gains or loses possession of something.   `Possession' means having some right to use a thing that one has in hand or otherwise has access to.  Different types of possession (e.g., ownership, rental, borrowings) can be specified by the using the appropriate element(s) of User-Rights-Attribute (q.v.).  Changes in an agent's user rights can come about in various ways: through buying and selling, renting, borrowing or lending, giving, repossession, etc.  Some subsets of this kind of change are Losing-User-Rights, Gaining-User-Rights, and Exchange-Of-User-Rights; in the latter class, there is an alteration in the rights of two (or more) agents to use two (or more) items -- as in a purchase, when one agent gets full use rights to an object by turning over a sum of money to the object's previous owner.  In addition, some changes in user rights are classified explicitly in Temporary-Change-Of-User-Rights (e.g., borrowing, renting), while others are permanent.   Events that involve such changes in user rights all belong in the collection of events, Change-In-User-Rights.   In any particular Change-In-User-Rights event, the item which is changing hands is identified as the Object-Of-Possession-Transfer.

An element ?CC of Calendar-Covering-Type  is itself a collection, a type of time interval, such that the union of all the instances of ?CC would completely cover all of time without overlap.  Thus, Calendar-Year is a Calendar-Covering-Type because all of time consists of a sequence of non-overlapping Calendar-Years.  Similarly Calendar-Month, Calendar-Day, Calendar-Hour, etc.  Notice that Monday and December are NOT instances of Calendar-Covering-Type, because all of time is not a sequence of Mondays, or Decembers.  Also notice that a collection Week -- defined as the set of all seven-day-long-periods-of-time -- would not be an instance of Calendar-Covering-Type, since several different Weeks could overlap; e.g., the week beginning today and the week beginning yesterday and the week beginning tomorrow.

         A collection of objects which are both tangible and intangible.  (See also the comment for its superset Composite-Tangible-And-Intangible-Object.)  Each element of Information-Bearing-Object is an object that can be interpreted, by an interpreter understanding its conventions, to yield a chunk or chunks of information.  Information-Bearing-Object includes all of the following: (1) artifacts made solely for the purpose of conveying information (e.g., a newspaper, or a children's science video); (2) artifacts that convey information in addition to their intended function (e.g., Neolithic pottery); and (3) non-artifacts, such as a person's fingerprints, gestures, and utterances, which may be interpreted to yield information.  Note: `an IBO' abbreviates `an information bearing object'.  Cf. Information-Bearing-Wave-Propagation.  See also Contains-Information.

Since this kind of purity is relative to specified chemical composition only, Pure-Compound (and Pure-Fn) does not pertain to mixtures in Cyc (such as Air).  Cf. Mixture, Chemical-Compound-Type.

         A collection of retail organizations.  Every element of Retail-Store is a Single-Site-Organization (but not necessarily a stand-alone business) which sells goods directly to consumers at store's Physical-Quarters.  Note that the Niemann-Marcus store at the Galleria is an instance of Retail-Store, but the Niemann-Marcus company as a whole is not, because it is a Retail-Store-Parent-Company (with multiple outlets); both are Retail-Organizations.

         A collection of collections.  Each element of Food-Group-Type is a collection of foodstuffs classified according to their nutritional contents.  When restricted to human foods, the elements of Food-Group-Type are familiar as the teaching tools used in public health education in order to promote nutritionally balanced diets.  Examples include: Dairy-Product, Cereal-Food-Group, Fruit-And-Vegetable-Food-Group, Meat-And-Legume-Food-Group.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of events.  In an instance of Transferring-Possession, the possession of a single object (i.e., the Object-Of-Possession-Transfer) is transferred from one Agent to another.  Thus, a Transferring-Possession event alters the rights of TWO different agents to use the object in question; one agent loses some User-Rights-Attribute over it, while the other agent gains some User-Rights-Attribute over it.  Each Transferring-Possession event is both a Losing-User-Rights event and a Gaining-User-Rights event.
Note:  In Buying events, Bartering events, Renting events, TWO such Transferring-Possessions occur, because there are TWO objects which transfer possession.  For example, in buying a car, the right to use the buyer's money is transferred to the auto seller, while the ownership of the car is transferred to the buyer.  Both of the Transferring-Possession events (one for each object) are Sub-Events of the instance of Buying, Renting, etc.  See Exchange-Of-User-Rights.

Two example types of Congenital-Condition are congenital herpes and congenital heroin addiction.  A Congenital-Condition may be caused by behavior of the mother during pregnancy.  Birth defects (such as having an extra toe) are Congenital-Conditions.  Injuries sustained during the delivery itself are not Congenital-Conditions.  Thus if forceps are used and the infant is scarred, brain-damaged or killed as a result, the situation is not an element of this collection.

Most formal languages (such as predicate calculus) and natural languages (such as English) are capable of composing propositions from fragments that are other propositions.  Elements of the subset Cyc-Formula (q.v.) are statements in such a language.

         The collection of amounts of currency or debt, of which payments, wealth, capital, assets, etc., consist.   An instance of Money may be considered as either (1) an amount of actual, valuable tangible goods (such as gold) or (2) an abstract quantity.  That is, from one perspective, elements of Money represent the amount of a debt (or credit), while from another perspective, they represent what is actually transferred to create or discharge a debt.  Typically, money is created by national governments; either (a) money is a backed claim for a certain amount of precious physical wealth payable by the government on demand (e.g., the gold standard), or (b) money is a legally enforced means of debt payment without any backing.  



Elements of Money in Cyc may be either a fixed amount, such as a U.S. five-dollar bill, or a range, such as `the price of a 1997 Mazda Protege'.  See Unit-Of-Money for the units used by Cyc to measure instances of Money. 



Note: The tangible coins, bills, checks, etc., that represent certain amounts of Money (but which as physical objects may have little value) are elements of Tender-Object, not of Money.  Elements of Tender-Object which also belong to Currency are typically associated with some instance of Unit-Of-Money (e.g., Dollar-United-States) and have a fixed value.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of events.  Each Daily-Personal-Cleaning encompasses the standard cleaning and grooming activities that an animal engages in over the course of a day.  Such a `daily routine' is almost sure to include many brief grooming and cleaning actions, such as licking one's paws, combing one's hair, washing one's hands, shaving, bathing, etc., and those are sub-events of that Daily-Personal-Cleaning event.  For example, a human's Daily-Personal-Cleaning might have a Teeth-Cleaning as one of its sub-events, along with a Taking-A-Bath, two instances of Combing-Hair, etc.  
Note:  Those specialized kinds of events, like Combing-Hair, are NOT subsets of Daily-Personal-Cleaning, since it would be abnormal for someone to JUST comb their hair each day (and do absolutely no other daily cleaning activity whatsoever).
Note:  In the context Human-Activities-Mt --- where all the performers of actions are, by default, human beings --- Daily-Personal-Cleaning designates human grooming activities only.  In that microtheory, dog-grooming performed by human beings does not constitute Daily-Personal-Cleaning, even if it happens on a daily basis for some pampered poodle, as it is not PERSONAL (i.e, self-) cleaning.

Items of clothing are usually made of flexible materials, such as cloth, leather, or yarn.  The collection Clothing-Item contains primarily individual garments (e.g., elements of the collections Pants, Shirt, Coat, Shoe), together with pairs of shoes, socks, and gloves (since each wearer needs a pair).  Jewelry, suspenders, belts, etc., are in the subset Clothing-Accessory.
Note: outfits (esp. specialized outfits) made up of several individual items worn together belong to the collection Clothing-Outfit, which is NOT a subset of Clothing-Item but IS a subset of the broader collection, Something-To-Wear.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of mathematical objects.  Each element of Quantifier represents a relationship between a variable and a formula.  In Cyc, a quantifier binds the variable found in its first argument within the formula that appears as its second argument.  Elements of Quantifier in CycL include :Forall, :Exists, There-Exist-Exactly, There-Exist-At-Least, There-Exist-At-Most.

         A collection of mental information.  Each element of Sensory-Information is the propositional content of a mental state in which the nervous system of an animal or other sentient perceives something.  For example, if I perceive that my office is hot, the information is that my [the perceiver's] office is hot; if you perceive that my eyes are brown, the information is that Deborah's eyes are brown.

         This is one important subset of 
Temporal-Thing.  The elements of Event are events or actions,
things that we say are `happening', changes in the state of the 
world.  Event is also a subset of Intangible, since an 
event consists of the `actions' per se, and THEY then refer 
to the tangible objects which participate in them.  
In contrast, the collection Something-Existing (another 
important subset of Temporal-Thing) has elements which have 
temporal extent yet are `static', such as a rock at the bottom 
of a pond.  



Note: While `Something-Existing vs. Event' might seem at 
first to be an 
obvious partition of things with temporal extent, there are 
interesting borderline cases -- 
such as agreements -- which Cyc treats as instances of 
Something-Existing, but which could also be represented as 
instances of Event.  And there are still other cases,
 such as the pure disembodied elements of Time-Interval, 
which are elements of Temporal-Thing yet belong neither to 
Something-Existing nor to Event.

Note:   Admiration (qv) is different than, or rather a more specialized form of, respect.  To feel Respect towards someone is just to feel that s/he should be treated with politeness and consideration, as having dignity; Admiration and Wonder-Admiration implies all of that, but also implies that the target of the Respect actually did something special or has some special quality that sets them apart from others (or at least from the respecter).  Respect is a Collection --- for an explanation of that, see Happiness.  Some more specialized Feeling-Attribute-Types than Respect are Reverence, Wonder-Admiration, Adulation, Awe, etc.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of translational motion events; hence a subset of Movement-Translation-Event.  In any element of Translation-Complete, the whole Object-Moving moves in its entirety from the origin (From-Location) to the destination (To-Location).  That is, the object completely leaves the origin and relocates at the destination.  The Object-Moving may be either a Non-Fluidlike object or a Fluid-Tangible-Thing all of which moves from one place to another; e.g., a baseball or the gasoline used to fill a gas tank.  Another example: a single molecule of water flowing from point A to B in a river.  Negative example: a river flowing from A to B  (the river itself is not relocated); a rubber band stretching.  A borderline case:  a spider spins a web, leaving part of itself, in effect, extended out behind it.  In most contexts that would still be considered a Translation-Complete event.
Note:  Translation-Complete is noncommittal as to whether net movement has occurred, so round-trip events qualify as complete translations.  (For contrast, see Translation-Location-Change).

         A collection of information transfer events.  Each element of Accessing-An-IBT is an action by which an agent accesses the content of some IBT (i.e., an element of Information-Bearing-Thing).  Examples include (getting information from) reading a newspaper, watching a film, listening to a musical performance, decoding an encrypted message, seeing a traffic police officer wave you on, or hearing your roommate ask you to take out the trash.  Of course, communication conventions play a role here.  In the Naive-Information-Mt, Cyc simply assumes that an agent who accesses an IBT understands its content afterwards.  In the Information-G-Mt, Cyc makes the more complicated inference that an agent who accesses an IBT understands its content afterwards only if the agent is able to get the encoded information using a convention familiar to that agent.  See also Communication-Convention, Has-Comm-Convention, Uses-Comm-Convention-For-Info.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of information transfer events; a subset of Communicating.  Each element of Communication-Act-Single is a single-source transmission of information from ONE Sender-Of-Info to one or more recipients; such acts may be one-to-one or one-to-many.  Every element of Communication-Act-Single has a transmission sub-event (which is an element of IBT-Generation-Original) and one or more reception Sub-Events (which are elements of Accessing-An-IBT).  An element of Communication-Act-Single starts when its transmission sub-event starts and ends when its accessing sub-event(s) end.
Notes: (1) For exchanges of information between or among multiple agents, see Multi-Directional-Communication.  (2) An important distinction is made between elements of Communication-Act-Single on the one hand, and their Sub-Events which are elements of IBT-Generation-Original and Accessing-An-IBT, on the other hand; e.g., Speaking and Writing are NOT subsets of Communication-Act-Single, but rather are subsets of IBT-Generation-Original (because instances of both represent only the generation of information and can even occur without actual communication of it), and Listening-Deliberately and Reading are subsets of Accessing-An-IBT, NOT of Communication-Act-Single, because instances of both represent only the accessing of information (even if by default they imply a prior generation of information).

         The collection Unit-Vector-Precise is a subset of Vector-Precise and of Unit-Vector-Interval.  Each element of Unit-Vector-Precise is a vector interval with a magnitude of 1 and a precisely specified direction (e.g., due North, straight down).  Thus, one precise unit vector differs from another only in direction, since each vector consists of a magnitude and a direction (in a space of n &gt; 1 dimensions).  So elements of Unit-Vector-Precise in effect indicate different directions such as `straight up' or `due East'.

For example, (Mother CHILD MOM) is functional in its second argument, since every animal has one and only one biological mother.

         A collection of edible stuff; a subset of Food-And-Drink.  Each element of the collection Food is a particular portion of food of a type which can, and habitually is, eaten (not drunk or inhaled) by humans or animals.  Here the notion of ``eating'' is important --- not drinking or inhaling or osmosing; an element of Food will generally require biting, chewing, etc.  A borderline example is a bowl of Jello; a borderline non-example is a very thick milkshake.  Even closer to the border is a bowl of vegetable soup so thick and chunky that each spoonful require chewing.  The edibles in Food provide calories and/or other nutrients that humans or animals need (e.g., protein, vitamins); this is often true with a Drink as well, but probably less than half the time (since most drinking is of water).

term.  Each instance has some format or organizing structure 
imposed on the information, although the format might not be 
intrinsically ordered..  An instance of Indexed-Info-Source 
is the abstract informational content of the source, not any 
particular physical object in which the information is stored.  
Examples include a Dictionary, Thesaurus, 
Database-Abstract-Content, or a Knowledge-Base.  Some examples that do not qualify are Painting-As-Art-Form, or a Character-String without any structuring information about it or that has no 
structure beyond being a string of characters.

Note:  Eyes are not Vibration-Through-A-Medium-Sensors because there need not be any physical medium for electromagnetic wave propagation.  This is a somewhat close call, and indeed in past centuries most people believed that light propagated through aether, but what it comes down to is this:  consider all the axioms that apply only to the structure, function, and operation, failure, etc. of a Vibration-Through-A-Medium-Sensor, and of that set how many hold true for eyes --- and the answer is No, most of them don't.  So parsimony dictates that Eye not be a subset of Vibration-Through-A-Medium-Sensor.

         A collection of tools.  An instance of Hardware-Tool is an object used to perform a task, usually by applying a particular kind of force on another object.  The tool is used to produce a physical effect in the position, structure, or arrangement of the other object.  Subsets of Hardware-Tool include Hammer, Screwdriver, Hand-Saw.  An electric drill is also a Hardware-Tool.  Borderline nonexamples include eating utensils, robot servants, screws, nails, and levers.

         What happens when you are in the hospital being treated for a disease like Cancer or Hepatitis or AIDS, or recovering from Surgery.  This is not just a Medical-Care-Event which happens in a hospital; it's the whole event meant by a hospital stay.  Also see Hospital-Room-Stay which only represents the stay in the room.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of mathematical objects.  Each element of Tuple is a complex which contains some number (greater than or equal to 1) of ordered (or otherwise indexed) components (it might be a pair, a triple, etc., or there may be a function from column names into their value domains).  For example, Blood-Pressure-Reading is a specialized subset of Tuple; each element of Blood-Pressure-Reading is an ordered or column-indexed pair (of numbers), in which the first is the systolic reading, the second the diastolic reading.  Components of tuples need not be restricted to numbers; for example, the entries in a data base (e.g., my address book) also qualify as tuples, whose components are name, address, phone, email address, etc.   A significant subset of Tuple is N-Tuple-Interval (q.v.), whose elements are tuples consisting of intervals only; e.g., complex numbers, physical vectors.  Technically, if the index set for the Tuple is the counting numbers in their usual order, then the implied order alone can be used to pick a member of the tuple, and the tuple is in fact a List-Sequence.  In the general case, any index set (distinct column names, for example, in a relational database) may be used to index the members of a tuple, not just their order-postion numbers.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of collections.  Each element of each element of Temporal-Stuff-Type is temporally substance-like.  Consider, e.g., Animal-Walking-Process, the set of all walking events.  Consider a particular walking event.  Videotape it.  Play back a few seconds of that videotape, showing one of many Time-Slices of the original walking event.  That shorter video is still clearly going to be a video of a walking event.  So the collection Animal-Walking-Process (the set of all walking events) is an element of Temporal-Stuff-Type; it is NOT an element of Temporal-Object-Type (q.v.).



Of course, there is a Granule-Of-Time for Animal-Walking-Process, namely, Taking-A-Step, such that any Time-Slices shorter than that are likely not to be considered real walking events.   This is analogous to granule-size for physical substance types such as peanut butter (the granules there are a peanut piece, a glob of peanut oil, etc.) or wood (the granule there is an individual plant cell).



More esoterically, consider a time slice of a person.   `Albert Einstein while at Princeton' was still a person.  So Person (the set of all people) is an element of Temporal-Stuff-Type.  All tangible objects are temporally stuff-like in this fashion.



If a collection COL :Direct-Types Temporal-Stuff-Type, it is reasonable to state axioms about the temporally intrinsic properties of COL's instances --- properties such as rate of speed, cost per pound, kinds of actors, etc.

      <rdfs:comment>
         The collection of all lists or finite sequences of items, as an abstract notion.  A List-Sequence is a special kind of Tuple that is a finite structure with a first and last member-position, and for each member-postion but the last, there is a succesor member-position.   A List-Sequence, like other Tuples, allows repetition of its members -- the same item can appear at multiple member-positions in the list.  A list can be viewed formally as a function from a finite index set of counting numbers, beginning with one or zero, into the domain of Things or perhaps some more restrictive domain.  Unlike Series, List-Sequence is purely abstract and the only implied relation between an item and its successor is the successor relation of the list itself.  List-Sequence is, technically, more specific than Tuple only in that the index set must be the counting numbers in their usual order rather than some other index set.

         A collection of devices.  
One can classify devices according to how many simultaneous 
users they typically have.  An instance of Device-Single-User
is any device that typically has/requires exactly one (i.e., 
one and only one) user.  A screwdriver (an instance of 
Screwdriver) is a Device-Single-User, but a grand piano 
(an instance of Grand-Piano) is not.  A borderline non-example 
is a car --- although only one person operates it, several can 
`use' it at once, i.e. derive the value of its primary function 
which is transportation.  So a car is not a Device-Single-User.
A borderline example is a telephone -- although it requires 
two or more users (each on telephones) for meaningful use, 
each phone generally has just one user at a time.  
So a telephone is a Device-Single-User but a telephone-circuit is not.

         A collection of events.  An instance of Transportation-Event is an event in which one object (in the role of Transporter) aids in the translational movement of another object (having the role of Transportees), so that both objects move together along the same Pathway-Complete.  Optionally, one of these objects, or some third object moving along with them, provides the force to make the movement happen (Provider-Of-Motive-Force).  Examples of transportation events include automobile transporation, dogs pulling goods on a sled, a wagon with groceries rolling down a hill, a person carrying a suitcase down the street, etc.  In that last case, note that the Transporter is the suitcase, not the person.  Things which are NOT Transportation-Events (as defined above): a river conveying some flotsam, the wind blowing a leaf, a conveyor belt moving a widget to the next person on the assembly line, or a walking beast of burden without Transportees on it.  In the first 3 of those, the would-be Transporter doesn't actually change its overall location; in the fourth case, the unburdened beast has no Transportees.  
Note:  This is a good example, by the way, of how Cyc concepts must be, and are, less ambiguous than words in English or any other natural language.  The cost of this is a larger vocabulary that must be used carefully, but the benefits are the ability to share knowledge in un-preconceived ways with others who subscribe to the same set of terms and intended meanings.

The Object-Emitted goes from (From-Location) a place inside of the Emitter to (To-Location) some place that is not within the Emitter.  The Emitter plays an active role (Done-By and Provider-Of-Motive-Force) in the emission.  Examples: the birth of a baby, a bullet shot from a gun, a venonous snake depositing poison.  Negative examples:  a person leaving a building (the building is not active), throwing a ball (the ball was not inside the person before the throwing).

For example, a Board of Education of a particular school district is a Local-Government-Organization, because its authority extends to schools in a limited (local) area; in the U.S., such a Board answers to another Local-Government-Organization, typically a city or township government.  In another example, an element of Veterans-Administration-Medical-Center is a local organization in terms of its service area, but bureaucratically it belongs to the U.S. Federal government; thus, Veterans-Administration-Medical-Center is a subset of both Local-Government-Organization and US-Federal-Government-Organization.

A Circulatory-System is a system of organs and body parts, found in Vertebrates and some other animals, which function together to circulate the animal's blood throughout its body, supplying needed substances to its cells and removing waste products from them.  A Circulatory-System is generally composed of Blood-Vessels, Heart, Spleen, etc., considered as an interrelated functional system of each animal. 
Note:  It generally has a close linkage to the respiration system, as the blood comes in contact with fresh air to divest itself of the waste products it has collected from the body's cells and to acquire new needed substances to take to the body's cells.

         A collection of information bearing objects (IBOs).  Each element of Published-Material is an IBO that belongs to a set of multiple copies which have identical information contents, embodied in similar physical form, and which have been produced for distribution.  Published-Material includes the published elements of Textual-Material (e.g., books and magazines); software duplicated for sale or distribution; and mass-produced elements of Recorded-Sound-Product.  Periodicals, advertisements, commercial films, annual business reports, tax schedules, all are sub-classes of Published-Material.  Examples of Published-Material: Cycorp's copy of `The New York Times' for July 4, 1996; my paperback copy of the novel `Parade's End'; Bill's copy of OS/2; Lisa's copy of `The White Album'.

         A collection of collections.  Every instance of Pure-Compound-Type is a collection which is a subset of both Pure-Compound and of some particular Chemical-Compound-Type (e.g., Carbon, Water, Cellulose).  Each instance of Pure-Compound-Type is defined ONLY by the properties of its Chemical-Compound-Type, and of Pure-Compound (q.v.).  For example, (Pure-Fn Fructose) is an instance of Pure-Compound-Type, but the subsets of Fructose, such as (say) `pure fructose derived from honey' would not be instances of Pure-Compound-Type.

The source is indicated with the predicate Emitter. An entire Translocation is associated with an emission, and these are related through the predicate Transfer-Out-Sub-Event.  If the thing which `comes out' is an instance of Partially-Tangible, then the event belongs to a more specific collection, Emitting-An-Object (q.v.). If the associated element of Translocation is an instance of Wave-Propagation, then the emission belongs to the more specialized collection, Emitting-A-Wave (q.v.).

         The collection of social events in which some kind of ritual is performed.  E.g., a wedding, an awards ceremony, a baptism, an inauguration, a graduation ceremony, etc.
Note: In Cyc's ontology, the collection Inauguration is not exactly a subset of Social-Ritual; e.g., it is not true that (:Direct-Types The1992InaugurationOfGeorgeBushAsPresidentOfTheUSA  Social-Ritual).  This is because there are many aspects to an Inauguration, besides the social ritual aspects.  E.g., there is the political aspect, namely the legitimate change of chief executive of a nation.  The carrying out of the `script' for an inauguration (i.e., the ceremony itself) is an element of the collection Social-Ritual.

         (:Direct-Types ?X Cyclical-Interval-Group-Type) means that ?X is a collection of interval types whose instances recur in a set pattern throughout all of calendar history.  ?X must partition all of time: the elements of ?X must be mutually disjoint, and unioned altogether they must encompass all time.  For example, ?X could be the set of the seven calendar days (Monday through Sunday), or the set of the twelve calendar months (January through December).  I.e., (:Direct-Types Day-Of-Week-Type Cyclical-Interval-Group-Type) and (:Direct-Types Month-Of-Year-Type Cyclical-Interval-Group-Type).  `Recurring in a set pattern' generally means that one can put the elements of ?X in order, say X1, X2,..., Xn, and there will be an instance of X1 immediately followed by an instance of X2 (that instance x2a of X2 will be Contiguous-After that instance x1a of X1),  and there will be an instance of X3 immediately following that particular instance of X2, and there will be an instance of X4 immediately following that instance of X3, etc.  One final note:  when we arrange elements of ?X into such a pattern X1,...Xn (whose repetitions then `tile' all time), n may be larger than the cardinality of ?X.  E.g., ?X might be the set with just the 2 elements WeekendDay (the union of the set Saturday and the set Sunday) and WeekDay, and then the arrangement that tiles all time is 5 contiguous WeekDays followed by 2 contiguous WeekendDays.

         A collection of events; a subset of both Controlling-Something and Physical-Contact-Event.  An instance of Handling-An-Object is an event in which an object is touched and manipulated by some Agent.  Examples of Handling-An-Object include instances of  Holding-An-Object and of Causing-Another-Objects-Translational-Motion.  So just holding a rock in your hand is a Handling-An-Object; so is washing your cereal bowl (an instance of Washing-Dishes), cutting a loose thread on your shirt (an instance of Cutting-A-Thread), and carrying the rock from one place to another (an instance of Carrying-While-Locomoting.)  One very important class of Handling-An-Object instances involve operating some hand-held device --- i.e., events which are instances of the collection Handling-A-Device.   I.e., the performer handles an object which happens to be a device, but not just lugging it around but actually employing it for its intended Primary-Function --- not merely to look at it or rearrange or relocate it.  For example, if you move a fork from the dishwasher to the silverware drawer, that's just Handling-An-Object; if you use that fork to eat some food, though, that is an instance of Handling-A-Device.

         The collection of all the types of Animal-Body-Parts.  An Animal-Body-Part-Type  is a characterization of body parts by structure and/or function.   Some elements of this collection include Spinal-Column, Eyelash, Nervous-System, Urethra, Wing-Animal-Body-Part, Heel-Of-Palm, etc.  As can be seen from those examples, Animal-Body-Part-Type is not organized along species/order/class/phylum/... taxonomic lines.

      <rdfs:comment>
         Instances of Complex-Temporal-Relation are predicates used to interrelate instances of Temporal-Thing in time.  Some of them (e.g., Starts-After-Ending-Of) make statements about the relationship of the beginning and/or end of their first argument to the beginning and/or end of their second argument.  One can think of this as an interval-based theory of time.  Some of them (e.g., Temporally-Intersects and Temporally-Subsumes) make statements about the relationship of the entire set of points that is their first argument to the entire set of points that is their second argument.  One can think of this as a set-theoretic theory of time.

         A collection of Cyc functions.  Dollar-United-States, Peso-Mexico, and Yen-Japan are each elements of this collection (along with functions for many other nations's monetary units).  Each of these is a function which, given real numbers as arguments, returns an instance of the collection Money (q.v.).  For example, (Dollar-United-States 5.99) denotes an element of Money whose size, or amount, is five dollars and 99 cents, expressed in the `unit of measure' US dollars; in short, (Dollar-United-States 5.99) denotes $5.99.  

Note: The monetary values associated with the members of Unit-Of-Money, and the exchange rates between them, fluctuate (sometimes widely) over very short periods of time -- daily, even hourly.  In being heavily time-dependent, Unit-Of-Money is unlike most other subsets of Unit-Of-Measure.

A predicate F is an element of Irreflexive-Binary-Predicate if and only if F is a binary predicate and, for every X in the domain of F, (:not (F X X)).  Examples: Spouse, Causes, North-Of, Temporally-Disjoint. 
Note this additional restriction: A Cyc predicate F can be an element of Irreflexive-Binary-Predicate only if the type (i.e., arg-Isa) constraint applicable to F's first argument is not disjoint with the type constraint applicable to F's second argument.

         The collection of attributes describing emotions and mental feelings.  An element of this set would be a particular `amount' of happiness, of confidence, of fear, etc.  Obviously there are no real `units of measure' for these quantities, but one can certainly say that the `amount' of happiness one felt at one's wedding was `more' than the happiness they felt at their college graduation ceremony, etc.  There are functions, such as Low-Amount-Fn, which take a Primitive-Attribute-Type (such as the instances of Feeling-Attribute-Type) and return as their value a certain-sized amount of that attribute-type; e.g., (Low-Amount-Fn Confidence) is an expression whose value is a low amount of confidence, and that in turn will be an element of Confidence, and also an element of Feeling-Attribute, and also an element of Attribute-Value, etc.  See especially the various subsets of Feeling-Attribute.
Note that Feeling-Attribute is NOT an element of Feeling-Attribute-Type.  Since Feeling-Attribute-Type is a subset of Primitive-Attribute-Type, any element of Feeling-Attribute-Type (such as Happiness) should have a total order among all its elements.  All the elements of Feeling-Attribute can't be placed in a total order (for example, how can we compare 'low happiness' with 'low contempt'?), so it should not be an element of Feeling-Attribute-Type.

         The collection of tiny microbes called viruses, each consisting mainly of a capsid (capsule chamber) containing viral DNA or RNA.  Viruses have no cells, but reproduce by inserting into living cells the viral DNA or RNA, which then uses cellular mechanisms to create new viruses.  Viruses cause many diseases in all other organisms; some can infect elements of Bacterium.  Virus excludes prions, bacteria, rickettsia, and protists.

         A collection of mathematical objects; a subset of N-Tuple-Interval.  For a measurable quantity, the ordered sequence of possible values may be thought of as a line.  Each element of Scalar-Interval is a line segment (or point) on such a line, representing a range of consecutive values.  The most common case is where the line is just the real number line, and the scalar interval is either a a contiguous set of points there (i.e., a range of numbers) or just a single point there (i.e., a number).  Another common case is where the line has some unit of measure marked off, such as meters.  In relation to the latter kind of interval, see also Unit-Of-Measure.

As represented in Cyc, credentials are intangible information, but each element of Credential usually has some associated physical document (e.g., a diploma associated with a college degree, a driver's license).  A credential may certify that the holder (i.e., the subject of the credential) has a particular skill (e.g., legal bar certification, ability to drive); has completed certain training (e.g., GED schooling, Ph.D. requirements; is allowed to do a certain thing (e.g., travel visa, permission slip); and so on.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of tangible objects; a subset of Physical-Device.  An instance of Non-Powered-Device is a device which is `inert' as opposed to being powered in any way.  Non-powered devices do not need to have any kind of energy supplied to them in order to function -- not even kinetic energy supplied by a user (except perhaps to move them into place).  E.g., a coat hanger.  Once you hang a coat up on it, it does its function without any motion, without any energy being converted or used, etc.  So this collection is a much smaller collection that than consisting merely of devices which don't require fuel or electricity (e.g., a hammer).  It should be noted that an inert device need not be Stationary during use (though many are); for example, tires are inert devices in the sense that once they are placed on a vehicle they don't require any energy input to do their job, which is, in essence `hanging onto a wheel no matter what!'.  A steering wheel, on the other hand, is not a Non-Powered-Device.  Further examples of Non-Powered-Devices include a table, a floor mat, a bookshelf, an auto ramp, a bookmark, a support column, and a shirt.

         A collection of collections.  Each element of Sibling-Disjoint-Attribute-Type is a collection of attributes.  If COL is such a collection, then nothing can have two instances of COL as attributes unless those two instances are related in a Subattribute-Of relationship to each other.  For example, Marital-Status-Of-People is an element of Sibling-Disjoint-Attribute-Type; no person can have (at the same time) the Marital-Status Married and the Marital-Status Single.  However, a person could have both the status Single and the status Divorced, if Single is a Subattribute-Of of Divorced.  See also Sibling-Disjoint-Collection.

         A collection of attributes; a subset of Physical-Attribute.  Each element of Hardness is an attribute describing how much pressure a tangible material can withstand before deforming or fragmenting.  Hardnesses may be characterized using a Generic-Value-Function (q.v.), or relative to certain substances, e.g., Hard-As-A-Rock.  Hardnesses of objects are reported using the predicate Hardness-Of-Object.

         A subset of Cell.  Ovum is the collection of specialized gamete cells produced by meiosis in the reproductive tract of female animals.  Each ovum usually has half the number of chromosomes that regular body cells do, and when fertilized by a spermatozoon, it becomes a zygote and continues to develop into a mature individual.  Also called 'egg'.  See also Female-Animal, Sexual-Reproduction-Event.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of transportation devices; a subset of Conveyance.  Each element of Transportation-Device is an artifact designed to play the role of Transporter in transportation events.  Such devices enable something to be moved, by (for example) carrying, pulling, or pushing the transported things (Transportees).  Transportation devices may or may not have their own power source (see Self-Powered-Device).  Those which do, such as automobiles and speedboats, constitute the specialization Transportation-Device-Vehicle.  Other transportation devices require an external motive force, e.g., instances of Wheelbarrow or Bicycle.  (For more examples, see Muscle-Powered-Device.)  Because Transporter and Transportees are specializations of Object-Moving, it follows that any object in the role of Transporter moves as a whole with those objects playing the role of Transportees.  Since any instance of Transportation-Device has playing the role of Transporter as its intendend function, stationary objects which cause motion, such as conveyor belts, escalators, rocket launchers, slingshots, etc. are excluded from the category of Transportation-Device.  Also excluded are devices which, although they facilitate travel, are worn rather than 'ridden on', 'ridden with', or 'ridden in'.  Ice skates, shoes, skis and other specializations of Wearable-Conveyance fit this exclusionary criterion. 
Note that this is not the collection of all objects that can be used as transporters. For example, in an event of a man riding on a horse, the horse is the transporter but not an instance of Transportation-Device since a horse is not an artifact. So the main difference between transporters and transportation devices is that the latter have to be artifacts while the former do not.

E.g., even though a person gathers information, we generally do not consider them to be a sensor, but rather the sensors are their eyes, ears, skin, etc.  In a context such as an ophthalmology convention, `well-known part' has a different binding, and they would consider just certain parts of the eye to be sensors.

An instance of Self-Powered-Device has an `on-board' part which converts some kind of potential energy into force.  That may be a battery and motor to convert electricity stored in the battery into kinetic energy (as in a cordless electric drill); other examples are the elements of Automobile, which (typically) convert gasoline and battery power to get the energy to move the vehicle.  Some muscle power is involved in operating both a cordless drill and an automobile, but not the main part of the power, in either case.  Negative exemplars of a Self-Powered-Device include a Bicycle (powered by the person that rides it) a Cable Car (pulled along by cabled embedded in the street) and subway train (often powered by an electrified `third rail').

         A collection of actions.  Each element of Single-Doer-Action is an action which can have only one `doer' (i.e., only one agent `doing' it).  Such events may be intentional or not.  Most bodily functions belong to subsets of this collection, because the only agent of a normal bodily function is the agent whose body it is  (e.g., Heartbeating, Bleeding).  For a type of action to be a subset of Single-Doer-Action, it must be inconsistent to assert, for any member of the subset, both (Done-By ACT X) and (Done-By ACT Y), where X and Y are different.  In contrast, Carrying-While-Locomoting is NOT a subset of Single-Doer-Action.  For, although an action of that kind might often be done by only one performer, it is also common for two or more people to cooperate in carrying something.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of specifications.  Each element of Product-Standard is a precise description applied to the instances of a particular Product-Type.  Manufacturers of that product type agree explicitly or in practice, or they may obey a government requirement, to make product designs following the specifications stated in the standard, so that products within the type will all have certain features in common.  For example, telephones and television sets fulfil certain product standards.  The resultant interchangeability allows compatibility with other devices and products, with public utilities, commercial trading expectations, governement purchasing requirements, etc.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of events; a subset of Monetary-Exchange-Of-User-Rights (among other supersets).  Each element of Renting is an event during which one agent grants to another agent the use of an object (owned or controlled by the first agent) in exchange for some remuneration.  The schedule of payment may vary, depending upon the rental period, type of object involved, type of usage granted, and/or other considerations.  The agent providing the object to rent is called the From-Possessor; the agent paying to use the object is called the To-Possessor.  Those agents enter into an Agreement (q.v.).  Examples of Renting might include:  Fred renting a particular apartment last year; Jane renting a car all this week; Jack renting a canoe on Saturday morning. See also Primary-Role-Use-Rights.

         The collection of individual sports events, such as a single game of baseball, an individual 100M race, etc.  An entire sandlot baseball game would be a Sports-Event, but one inning wouldn't be.  A double-header could be viewed as a single Sports-Event, though, even though each half of it was also a Sports-Event.  Several Sports-Events can be organized into a Sports-Formal-Competition.  One single double-header evening of baseball would not be a Sports-Formal-Competition, nor one single tennis match, etc.  
note:  The collection Sports-Event does not include every Athletic-Activity; e.g., Rocky training for his boxing match, a group of kids racing to the bus stop, a person skiing for pleasure, etc. are not instances of Sports-Event.

Functionally, this ends when the child begins to take responsibility for themselves, work, have children of their own,... or, at latest, when the person's age greatly exceeds that at which most people reach those milestones.  Generally, this means that it spans the period from birth to teenage years.   This is highly dependent on context, of course; childhood in Shakespeare's culture ended around age 12.

         A collection of physical objects.  An instance of Currency is a physical object generally accepted as legal tender (i.e., not checks or credit cards) and used as a means of transferring a quantity of Money between some elements of Agent.  Elements of Currency may be coins, items of precious metal, paper bills for which precious objects are payable by a government to the bearer on demand, or unbacked paper bills required by a government to be accepted for payment of debts.  Elements of Currency are typically backed by and issued by national governments.
Note: This collection includes all instances of legal tender, worldwide and historically.  But, for better or worse, the notion of legal tender is context-dependent.  Normally what counts as currency is relative to the country one is in; legal tender in the United States is not the same as legal tender in China.  (Though US dollars may have excellent value on the black market.)  What counts as legal tender depends on historical events as well, since a government may change, withdraw, or cancel some types of currency it previously authorized.  Also, conquest of one country by another usually brings about the collapse of the loser's currency.  A Confederate ten dollar bill, e.g., is not an element of Currency in the context of twentieth century Alabama, even though it belongs to Currency in a different context.

         Static-Situations are states of affairs between two or more things, persisting statically over some time interval. Static-Situations always have a temporal extent; they usually have a tangible and spatial extent.   As an example, consider the situation of Bill Clinton sitting in his easy chair on the evening of 7/4/96.   There are participant objects such as Bill and the chair, there are relationships such as the seat of the chair supporting his bottom and his weight being off his feet, etc.   It happens at a particular time and place, but there is no active, dynamic Event that is going on.

In many, but not all, cases (e.g., Making-Pottery), an instance of Shaping-Something is also a Creation-Event,   Normally, elements of Shaping-Something are concerned with the basic, overall shape of an object.  Thus, a Polishing-Something event, which doesn't affect the basic shape of the Object-Of-State-Change, is not a Shaping-Something.

         A collection of collections.  Each element of Climate-Cycle-Type is a collection of (extended) events which are weather processes of one type or another.  Examples of elements of Climate-Cycle-Type are Temperate-Climate-Cycle and Steppe-Climate-Cycle.  
Note: in practice, there is little need to create terms denoting members of the collections belonging to Climate-Cycle-Type; so long as one just wants to state what TYPE of climate a particular region has, simply use the predicate Has-Climate-Type with the appropriate subset of Annual-Climate-Cycle (q.v.).  See also Has-Climate-Type.

         A collection of edible stuff.  Each element of the collection Food-And-Drink is a food or beverage of a type which people or animals (or whatever the current microtheory is restricting its attention to --- e.g., some species of oil-eating bacteria) can and normally do consume.   Elements of Food-And-Drink may or may not require further preparation before the eaters find them palatable, medically safe, digestable, etc.  See Food-Ready-To-Eat for the subset of these items that are ready for immediate consumption.  In various microtheories, the elements of Food-And-Drink will be restricted or expanded; e.g., in the Human-Activities-Mt this collection is limited to only foods or beverages that modern-day human beings consume.  Some examples of Food-And-Drink includes a scoop of ice cream (an instance of Ice-Cream), a pepperoni pizza (an instance of Pizza), an apple (an instance of Edible-Fruit), a lump of bread-dough (an instance of Dough which, after preparation, will become an instance of edible Bread), a double espresso (an instance of Coffee-Beverage), a mouthful of hay that a horse is about to swallow (an instance of Hay), etc.  The latter (the hay) is not an instance of Food-And-Drink in the Human-Activities-Mt.  Note that Food-And-Drink does NOT include such things as spices, condiments, sauces, drugs, etc., which --- though they are nevertheless Edible-Stuff --- do not constitute a food by themselves; those belong to other subsets of Edible-Stuff but not to Food-And-Drink.  E.g., a particular pinch of oregano would be an instance of Food-Ingredient-Only (q.v.).  Also see: Default-Disjoint-Food-Types.

Every instance of Element-Stuff is a piece of tangible stuff, composed of a quantity of atoms, all of which are of the same chemical element.  That is, every atom in an individual piece of Element-Stuff has the same number of protons in its atomic nucleus as does every other atom in that piece.  For example, all pieces of carbon are instances of Element-Stuff.   All pieces of two of Carbon's subsets, Diamond and Graphite, also are instances of Element-Stuff.  On the other hand, instances of Water, because they are constituted of both (some) Hydrogen and (some) Oxygen atoms, do not belong to the collection Element-Stuff.

An instance of Kinetic-Energy-Powered-Device does not have an `on-board' energy source incorporated into it, at least not one supplying the bulk of the power requirements of the device.  Instead, its operating power is supplied by the kinetic energy from something else in motion -- such as animal muscle power (including human labor), wind energy, or hydraulic power.  Examples include elements of the collections Hammer and Piano-Acoustic. (Contrast with Self-Powered-Device --- e.g., an electric organ is a Self-Powered-Device, not a Kinetic-Energy-Powered-Device.)

      <rdfs:comment>
         Situation is the collection of situations.  A situation is a state of affairs; it identifies roles played by objects involved in the situation, and it articulates the relationships between those roles.  One important partitioning of Situation is:

(1) Event --- the dynamic situations.
(2) Static-Situation. --- they exist in time, but are not dynamic, more a set of relationships among objects.  E.g., consider the situation of Bill Clinton sitting in his easy chair on the evening of 7/4/96.   There are participant objects such as Bill and the chair, there are relationships such as the seat of the chair supporting his bottom and his weight being off his feet, etc.  There is a fuzzy line between Events and Static-Situations: one could think of Bill as `carrying out the process of sitting' while he's in his easy chair.  
(3) atemporal situations.  There are some abstract, non-spatial, non-temporal instances of Situation.  This is not very common, though; most situations of interest have (dynamic or static) temporal properties, and are instances of Temporal-Thing.

         A collection of illocutionary forces.  Each instance of Promise consists of a piece of information contained (perhaps implicitly) in a communication, and which expresses the speaker's intention of assuring the listener that s/he, the speaker, will in the future perform the action described in that utterance and/or bring about the situation described therein.  A promise, unlike an offer, is not conditional on the acceptance of the listener.   `Speaker' and `listener' are broadly interpreted to mean, respectively, any Sender-Of-Info and Recipient-Of-Info.

         #$Predicate
      </Name-In-Cyc>
      <rdfs:comment>
         The set of all Cyc predicates.  Each element of Predicate is a truth-functional relationship in Cyc which takes some number of arguments; each of those arguments must be of some particular type.  For example, the predicate :Direct-Superclasses, which represents the subset/superset relation between collections, takes two arguments; each argument must be an element of Collection.  The numbers and types of arguments to particular predicates are specified by explicit assertions using Arity, Arg1-Isa, Arg2-Isa, etc., Arg1-Genl, Arg2-Genl, etc.  Our example :Direct-Superclasses has Arity 2, and both its Arg1-Isa and its Arg2-Isa have the value Collection.  







Informally, you can think of elements of Predicate as functions that always return either true or false.  More formally, when an element of Predicate is applied to the legal number and type of arguments, an expression is formed which is a well-formed formula (wff) in CycL.  Such expressions are called `atomic formulas' if they contain variables, and `gafs' (short for `ground atomic formulas') if they contain no variables.  







Note that in Cyc, relationships involving opaque contexts (such as modal contexts, propositional attitudes) are NOT included in Predicate; see Modal-Relationship instead.  Quantifiers and logical operators are also excluded from Predicate; see Quantifier, Logical-Connective.











Currently (July 1996), the KB includes predicates of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 arguments; i.e., Arity may have a value between 1 and 5, inclusive.  The KB also includes some predicates of variable arity (see Variable-Arity-Relation).  Unary predicates, which take just one single argument (e.g., `-- is a person' or `-- is white', are usually represented in Cyc by elements of Collection or Attribute-Value, rather than of Predicate; but see also Unary-Predicate.  Naming strings for elements of Predicate always begin with a lowercase letter.

         A collection of events; a subset of Taking-Something and of Gaining-User-Rights.  In an instance of Appropriating-Something, an Agent takes something that no one else has user rights over, such as air for breathing, or some object which at that time belongs to no one (e.g.,a dime lying in the street).
Note: The English verb `appropriate' can also mean to take something away from someone else, against their will and wrongfully, but that is not what is meant here.  For that, see Stealing-Generic.

         A collection of events.  In each Shaving-Something event, thin pieces of material on an object's surface are removed.  An example would be someone whittling a wooden spoon, someone using a lathe to make a table leg, someone scraping the top layer of mold and cheese off a brick of cheese that was left in the refrigerator just a little too long, etc.  
WARNING: an event in which someone ``shaves'' their body hair (a Shaving-Body event) from one's face, legs, etc. with a shaver or razor is NOT a  Shaving-Something event; rather, it is an element of the collection Cutting-Something.  If one uses a depilatory such as Nair, then one could actually ``shave'' (genuinely a Shaving-Something event) the resultant coating of depilatory and separated hair ends away.

         A collection of events.  Each element of Information-Transfer-Event is an event in which information is transferred from a source (Information-Origin) to a destination (Information-Destination), both of which are either intelligent agents or IBTs (i.e., elements of Information-Bearing-Thing).  Examples: reading a book (transfer from book to reader); saying something to someone (transfer from speaker to listener); machine translation (transfer from an encoded IBT in the source language to an encoded IBT in the target language); OCR scanning (transfer of info from visual information source to another IBT in different format); carving initials in a tree (transfer from agent to IBT), etc.  Note: this is a generalization of the `mtrans' operator in Roger Schank's Conceptual Dependency theory.

         The collection of acts concerned with an agent's intentionally moving one part of its body relative to another part of its body.  The energy source is the agent's own body, not some external force.  Each instance of Waving-A-Hand is an instance of Voluntary-Body-Movement --- the focus of that action is on the hand moving relative to the body.  By way of constrast, an instance of Opening-A-Drawer is probably not going to be an instance of Voluntary-Body-Movement, even though the person opening the drawer probably does move their hand relative to their body, because the focus of the Opening-A-Drawer action is not on the hand moving, but rather on the drawer opening.

         The collection of all Cyc collections.  Cyc collections are natural kinds or classes, as opposed to mathematical sets; their elements have some common attribute(s).  Each Cyc collection is like a set in so far as it may have elements, subsets, and supersets, and may not have parts or spatial or temporal properties.  Sets, however, differ from collections in that a mathematical set may be an arbitrary set of things which have nothing in common (see Set-Mathematical).  In contrast, the elements of a collection will all have in common some feature(s), some `intensional' qualities.  In addition, two instances of Collection can be co-extensional (i.e., have all the same elements) without being identical, whereas if two arbitrary sets had the same elements, they would be considered equal.   As with any Cyc constant, an instance of Collection should be created only if it is expected to have some purpose or utility.  Moreover, the `best' collections to create are the ones which are impossible to define precisely, yet about which there are rules and other things to say.  E.g., `WhiteCat' is not a good element of Collection to create, because it's easy to define with other Cyc concepts, and there's not much to say about the collection of white cats; but `WhiteCollarWorker' could be a good element of Collection, because it is hard to define exactly, yet there are many things to say about it.

         The collection of attributes that indicate a person's social class, as determined by the person's general lifestyle, quality of life, and relative access to the (material and security oriented) desiderata of life.  It may depend on a cultural non-material system of social rank, based on birth, office, manners, vocal accent or other factors.  Members of this collection include Lower-Middle-Class, Upper-Class, etc.

         A collection of events in which some object decomposes.  I.e., in a Decomposition-Process event, some object's matter undergoes chemical reactions (sometimes mediated by microorganisms) that eventually result in the object losing its shape and material characteristics.  This may sometimes superficially resemble Melting, but it is a different process.

         The collection Unit-Vector-Interval is a subset of Vector-Interval.  Each element of Unit-Vector-Interval is a vector interval with a magnitude of 1.  Thus, one unit vector differs from another only in direction, since each vector consists of a magnitude and a direction (in a space of n &gt; 1 dimensions).   An element of Unit-Vector-Interval may specify either a precise unit vector or a generalized range of directions such as `in front of'.  See also Unit-Vector-Precise.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of collections.  Each element of Interconvertible-Unit-Type is a collections of functions (all belonging to Unit-Of-Measure) that are used to measure quantities whose units are convertible into one another.  Some collections of interconvertible units include Unit-Of-Time, Unit-Of-Distance, Unit-Of-CPU-Speed.   For example, Unit-Of-Time includes the functions Hours-Duration and Seconds-Duration (among others).  Any quantity denoted by applying one of those functions can also be expressed in terms of the other.  For example, (Hours-Duration 1) equals (Minutes-Duration 60).  On the other hand, not all the instances of Unit-Of-Measure constitute types of interconvertible units. Unit-Of-Rate is not an element of Interconvertible-Unit-Type; therefore, it does not necessarily follow that quantities denoted by its elements are interconvertible.  For example, Times-Per-Day and Miles-Per-Hour are both elements of Unit-Of-Rate; however, quantities denoted using either function are not convertible into one another.

         The collection of all instances of abstract information stored or transmitted in some manner, and representing (to someone potentially at least) something.  Abstract information need not have any propositional content (see Propositional-Information-Thing); a score for music, or a bit-map, are examples.  Note that Abstract-Information is the abstract, intangible information, not any particular physical embodiment.  The same abstract information is often stored in many different physical Information-Bearing-Objects.  Abstract-Information may or may not be digital; it need not be representable in a particular number of bits.  Abstract-Information does not include every abstract Intangible or 'Platonic' concept, only that information that represents something and is (at least potentially) stored or transmitted for that purpose; thus, the ideal regular icosahedron is not in itself an instance of Abstract-Information.  Note also that although most instances of Abstract-Information are Intangible-Individuals, some are Set-Or-Collections such as Biological-Taxons and other Conventional-Classification-Types.

Examples:  William Tell shooting the arrow off his son's head,  John Wilkes Booth shooting Abraham Lincoln, the last time you tossed a frisbee to someone, a pilot landing an airplane, and a skiier skiing one run of the downhill course.

         A collection of information transfer events; a subset of Communicating.  Each element of Visual-Communicating is an action in which information is transmitted by visual media.  Every element of Visual-Communicating has at least one Communication-Token which is an instance of Visual-Information-Source.  Examples of Visual-Communicating: a performance by mime Marcel Marceau; Seiji Ozawa conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra; a policeman directing traffic; shaking a fist at someone in anger; sending a message with flags, light pulses, or smoke signals.

         A collection of events; a subset of IBT-Generation-Replication.  Each element of IBT-Copying is an event which generates a new IBT (i.e., an element of Information-Bearing-Thing) by copying the information and format from a source IBT (see Information-Origin).  The new IBT encodes approximately the same information in approximately the same way as the source IBT.  Examples: photocopying a document, faxing a document, duplicating a videotape.

A collection belonging to Unordered-Attribute-Type contains values that are incommensurable with one another.  For example, the `suit' attribute of playing cards (unlike the number or face value of the cards) is an unordered attribute in card games where no suit is considered higher than another.  The `gender' attribute of animals is an Unordered-Attribute-Type, as well.  By contrast, see Primitive-Attribute-Type.

Belonging to this collection implies nothing about the current configuration of the object; in particular, elements of Sheet-Of-Some-Stuff need not be lying flat.  Aluminum foil on a roll or a bedspread crumpled up on a bed are instances of Sheet-Of-Some-Stuff. Cf. Sheet-Shaped, Two-Dimensional-Shape.

         A collection of tangible objects.  Each instance of Something-To-Wear is an object that an animal (usually a person) wears on its body, i.e., in a Wearing-Something event.  It is worth remarking that, in such an event, the wearer doesn't have to exert any intentional effort to continue wearing the object.  For example, shirts remain on people's torsos, hats stay on heads, rings on fingers; once in place, dog collars stay on dogs, saddles stay on horses.  By contrast, a hula hoop is NOT an example of Something-To-Wear.  A borderline case is a Purse, which at first blush seems to be something to wear, yet requires carrying by the performer, hence is not a member of this collection.  Similarly, a briefcase is not an Something-To-Wear.

         A collection of physical devices; the most general collection of electrical devices.

Instances of Electrical-Device include both complex devices (e.g., elements of the collections Stereo-System or Computer) and simpler ones (e.g., elements of Electrical-Components and Electronic-Components).
Note:  in some contexts, crystal radios might be classified as inert (unpowered) electrical devices; the same for some sorts of passive radar detectors.  These are exceptional cases, but still elements of this collection.  In other contexts, the power for these devices can be viewed as being supplied from the outside, hence they are clearly `powered' in such contexts.

It is not necessary that the agent touch the Object-Controlled, only that s/he have an efficacious means of controlling its action -- thus, instances of Controlling-Something include all instances of Guiding-A-Moving-Object (some of which involve a Remote-Control-Device).  Further subsets: Handling-An-Object, Braking, Steering-A-Device-By-Hand, Playing-A-Musical-Instrument, Cutting-Fabric,  Carrying-While-Locomoting, Flushing-A-Toilet, etc.  Whenever a Control-Device (qv) is being used, for its primary function, presumably a Controlling-Something event is taking place.  Borderline examples include having a conversation by telephone, doing the dishes by hand, and having a cat as a pet.

         A collection of illocutionary forces.  Each instance of Query consists of a piece of information contained (perhaps implicitly) in a communication, and which expresses the speaker's intention of asking the listener whether the state of affairs described in the utterance in fact holds.  The speaker's ultimate goal may be either to learn the information or to test the knowledge of the agent queried.   `Speaker' and `listener' are broadly interpreted to mean, respectively, any Sender-Of-Info and Recipient-Of-Info.  See also Illocutionary-Force, Requesting-Information.

         The collection of microtheories that are used in applications as a means to reason about particular situations.  Every original query takes place in some Problem-Solving-Cntxt (as opposed to a General-Microtheory) which has access --- via the Subcontext-Of relation --- to other relevant microtheories, all the way up to the most general one, the Base-KB.  A Problem-Solving-Cntxt is ususally created temporarily for the problem at hand, and is discarded after the problem is dealt with (unlike a General-Microtheory, which is created for lasting use).

         The collection of all connected Path-Systems that are not in separate pieces.  For any different points X and Y in such a system SYS, there is a path PATH in SYS that both X and Y are on.  Another way to put this is that SYS is an instance of Connected-Path-System iff for any different points X and Y in SYS, there is a path PATH in SYS such that (Path-Between-In-System PATH X Y SYS) holds.  Note that according to this definition, a connected path system does not have to contain a link--a path system containing a single node will be a connected path system.  If a connected path system contains a link, nevertheless, every two different points must be connected by a path. Note also that because of our treatment of path (see Path-In-System) and our restriction of points in SYS that are not nodes (see Node-In-System), that there is a path between every two points in SYS is equivalent to that there is a path between every two nodes in Sys.

         The most general collection of ailment events; a subset of Physiological-Condition, and a subset of Event.  An instance of Ailment-Condition is a dynamic state of sickness, injury, or physiological impairment.  Having an ailment is an event:  it has temporal aspects, it progresses dynamically, etc., it is not just `being in some static state of un-wellness.'   Some subsets of Ailment-Condition are: Respiratory-Ailment, Heart-Condition, Cancer, Motion-Sickness, Poisoning, Infection, Injury-Condition.  If a particular person suffers from asthma, that is an element of Ailment-Condition.  Each Ailment-Condition is a state of actual, developed sickness or impairment, rather than the event of getting sick or becoming impaired.  Also note that each type of ailment, such as Asthma, is the set of all `cases' or `instances' of individuals suffering from that condition.

         Movement-Translation-Process is the subset of Movement-Translation-Event whose elements can be pragmatically considered to be continuous processes.  In any instance of Movement-Translation-Process, all time-slices of that process are also themselves elements of Movement-Translation-Process.  
Note that walking is a type of Movement-Translation-Process, even though it involves some nonzero accelerations and jerks.
A non-example would be a plot of the various residences you've lived in (``moved to'') over the course of your lifetime; another non-example would be Captain Kirk beaming up to the Enterprise; another would be the ``tunneling'' of an electron in a tunnel diode.
Note:  If you believe in quantum mechanics, then ultimately all physical motion is series of discrete, discontinous ``hops''.   This is where ``PRAGMATICALLY'' continuous vs. discontinuous comes in; i.e., in a quantum physics context some particular motion might be considered discontinuous, whereas in some naive everyday context that same motion is considered continuous.

Sensory attributes that may occur with more or less intensity are represented by indicating a Level-Of-Pain, Level-Of-Physical-Pleasure, Level-Of-Stress, etc.

Note that this predicate is NOT properly used for any other purpose (e.g., to describe metal fatigue, or the depletion of natural resources, or the gradual inhibition that a single cell devlops to repeated stimuli, etc., even though in English the words `exhaustion' and `fatigue' have those meanings.)  This is a good example of how Cyc's internal representation must, and does, disambiguate different concepts even though they might be metaphors for each other, and even though those distinct meanings might be mixed together at a word level in a natural language like English.

Respiration concerns the exchange of Oxygen and waste gasses with the environment.  Circulation concerns distributing the oxygenated Blood to the cells.  The oxygen carrier (hemoglobin) releases the oxygen to the cells, allowing chemical reactions necessary to sustain the cell life, which in turn sustains the life of the breather.

         A collection of measurable intervals; a subset of Scalar-Interval.  Each element of Interval-On-Number-Line is an interval on the real number line; for example, the interval described by `numbers greater than zero and less than or equal to 10'.  A common special case of such intervals is that of a single point on that line, viz., a number such as five or 125.  Note that such an interval need not be contiguous; e.g., `even numbers between Pi and the square root of 1000' describes a legitimate element of Interval-On-Number-Line.  The collection Real-Number is a subset of Interval-On-Number-Line.  The elements of Interval-On-Number-Line are measured by elements of Dimensionless-Unit-Of-Measure, e.g., units or percentages.  See also Unity, Percent, Unit-Of-Measure.

         A collection of microscopic-scale objects; a subset of Chemical-Object.  Every instance of Molecule is a microscopic object whose component atoms are all chemically bonded to each other; typically, this means that the atoms are covalently bonded.  Examples: some instances of Molecule, including molecules of oxygen (O2), ozone (O3), water (H2O), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), etc., contain covalently bonded atoms belonging to the collection Oxygen.  Some highly complex examples of Molecule are those belonging to the collection DNA.  See also Molecule-Fn.
Note: Diamond and other macroscopic covalent solids are excluded from belonging to Molecule by the constraint that instances of Molecule are microscopic.

E.g., a ball bouncing in place translates periodically; so does a planet revolving around a star.  But not: a planet rotating on its axis, a top spinning in place.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of predicates and functions.  Each element of Modal-Relationship is a predicate or function wherein substituting equals for equals may not preserve truth.  For example, `believes': even though Jack's age is equal to 29, we can't substitute `29' for `Jack's age' in the sentence `Fred believes that Jack's age is 31', because Fred surely does NOT believe that 29 is 31.  Thus, `believes' is a modal relationship.  So are meta-predicates such as My-Creator: e.g., suppose that Doug Lenat added the term FirstUSPresident to the Cyc ontology, and Cyc later is told that that person was George Washington, who in turn is represented by the term George-Washington, which term was NOT entered by Doug but by Karen Pittman; it would be incorrect to substitute equals for equals [that is, to substitute George-Washington for FirstUSPresident] in the assertion (My-Creator FirstUSPresident Lenat) and conclude (My-Creator George-Washington Lenat), since Doug did not enter the latter term into Cyc's ontology.  Thus, meta-predicates such as My-Creator are also modal relationships.  The same applies to functions; e.g., if we had a function such as MyCreatorFn, then (MyCreatorFn FirstUSPresident) would not have the same value as (MyCreatorFn George-Washington).

Physiological-Condition is the most general collection of such states.

An instance of Guiding-A-Moving-Object is an event in which an agent guides or steers an object which is in motion.  For example, someone steering a car or a motorcycle, controlling a surfboard, or flying a kite.  If all you `guide' is a rotation, then that is not quite a Guiding-A-Moving-Object event.  Also, if no motion actually takes place, then it would be stretching things to call that a `guiding.'  So a marginal example is Running (you are guiding yourself) and two marginal non-examples are:  spinning in place, and running in place.

         A collection of collections.   Every element of Stuff-Type is a collection of substances which have the following logical property: such a substance may be subdivided, spatially or temporally, and the resultant portions will also be instances of the Stuff-Type collection to which the original substance belonged.  Elements of Stuff-Type may be collections of any kind of stuff, tangible or intangible, temporal or atemporal, which has that property.  (The notion of Stuff-Type corresponds roughly to that of a mass noun in English.)   Thus, if COL is some collection that is an element of Stuff-Type, and ITEM is an element of COL, then if ITEM is divided into two (or more) segments, each segment is also an element of COL.  Examples of Stuff-Type: Water (the collection of all portions of water, whose spatial sub-portions are also water); Breathing (the collection of all events wherein someone breathes for any amount of time, whose temporal sub-events are also instances of Breathing).  Note that `taking a complete breath' would NOT be stufflike, since not every temporal interval of breathing would be a complete breath from start to finish; cf. Object-Type.  See also these four collections: Stuff-Type, Object-Type, Existing-Stuff-Type, and Existing-Object-Type.

         Instances of Holiday-Season are events which encompass the activities around a Holiday (or group of Holidays).  The clearest example is Christmas-Season.  While the exact boundaries of a Holiday-Season may be vague, it is nonethless a useful concept; in fact, much of the usefulness comes from that very fuzziness: it is hard to define exactly, but there are many things worth saying about it.

         A collection of events.  In an instance of Losing-User-Rights, some Agent loses possession of something.  Thus, in such an event, that agent loses a previously held right (viz., some User-Rights-Attribute) to use some item.  The item in question is identified as the Object-Of-Possession-Transfer, and the agent is the From-Possessor (i.e., the one from whom possession is taken).  The Agent may or may not be a Deliberate-Actors in the event; e.g., selling one's car is done on purpose, but having one's car repossessed probably isn't.  If either of those two events happen to you, though, it is an element of the collection Losing-User-Rights.

      <rdfs:comment>
         The enjoyment of pleasurable satisfaction that goes with well-being, security, effective accomplishments, or satisfied wishes.  As with all Feeling-Attribute-Types, this is a Collection -- the set of all possible amounts of happiness one can feel.  One instance of Happiness is `extremely happy'; another is `just a little bit happy'.  
Note:  Obviously there are no real units of measure for this quantity, ways of objectively measuring the amount of happiness possessed or gained or lost, etc., but still this has proven to be a useful way for Cyc to represent and reason with emotions.  E.g., one can have a rule that says that most people have a greater `amount' of happiness at their wedding than at their high school graduation, etc.  There are functions, such as Low-Amount-Fn, which take a Primitive-Attribute-Type (such as the instances of Feeling-Attribute-Type) such as Happiness and return as their value a certain-sized amount of that feeling; e.g., (Low-Amount-Fn Happiness) is an expression whose value is a positive but small amount of happiness, and that in turn will be an element of Happiness (and also will be an element of Feeling-Attribute and an element of Attribute-Value, etc.)  Feeling-Attribute-Types organize into a lattice; e.g., there are several more specialized forms of Happiness that are present in Cyc's ontology, such as Elation, Delight, Triumph-The-Feeling, etc.

         A collection of objects.  Each element of Group is a composite object, made up of individual members which may be either events or objects.  A group is related to its members by the predicate Group-Members (q.v.).  Note that elements of Group are NOT collections; consider: a group has temporal extent and may have spatial extent and location, while a collection is timeless and abstract.  Nonetheless, it is possible to define a collection parallel to any group, so that the Group-Members of that group are also instances (:Direct-Types's) of the correlated collection; e.g., each toe on my left foot is both an element of the collection of my left toes and a member of the group of toes on my left foot.  But that group (of my left toes) is a spatiotemporal thing, while the correlated collection (of my left toes) is NOT.  Another example: if I consider a certain flock of pigeons as having a location, a spatial extent, and a time of existence, then I am considering (the pigeon flock) a group and NOT a collection.  As a default, a group whose Group-Members are elements of Something-Existing is itself an element of Something-Existing; and a group whose Group-Members are elements of Event is itself an element of Event.  Finally, unlike a collection, a group cannot be empty; a group must have some Group-Members, or there is no group (at that point in time).  Examples of Group: Queens-Guard, Three-Wise-Men, Santas-Reindeer, International-Community.

      </Name-In-Cyc>
      <rdfs:comment>
         The collection of functions in the Cyc language whose uses are to be treated as NATs (non-atomic terms).  In other words, these functions, when applied to arguments, form new terms that may then freely appear as arguments in other CycL expressions.  For example, consider Government-Fn.  It takes one argument, such as France, and the resulting NAT --- in this case (Government-Fn France) --- can be used anywhere in CycL expressions that an instance of Regional-Government could occur.  We could, instead, have created a specific new term `GovernmentOfFrance', asserted that it :Direct-Types Regional-Government, etc., but by having NATs we can drastically reduce the total size of the Cyc vocabulary of constant terms.  



This collection does not include: 

1) abstract functions, like the one-to-one function that must exist between the positive integers and the rational numbers; 

2) Lambda functions (functions which bind variables in arbitrary CycL expressions; The-Set-Of is an example); 

3) Predicates.  Predicates can be thought of as functions from a set of arguments to a truth value.  Wffs that start with a predicate can even serve as terms, i.e., as arguments to other predicates, but when they do so they can't just be replaced with their truth value!  So Predicate is a subset of Function-The-Mathematical-Type but not a subset of Non-Predicate-Function.

Note:  This is different from the collection Recreational-Activity in the following way: entertainment events are necessarily done for the enjoyment or recreation of someone else; in other words, there is an audience.  Also, the performers of a Recreational-Activity are generally doing it `for fun', and (expect to) enjoy it, whereas some or all of the performers of an Entertainment-Event may be doing it as a Working-Event --- i.e, `for a living' and may (expect to) not enjoy it.

         The collection of all organizations.  Each element of the collection Organization is a group whose Group-Members are instances of Intelligent-Agent, and which is established such that certain known relationships and obligations exist between the members, and/or between the organization and its members, and/or between the organization and `outsiders' (individuals or groups).  Organization includes both informal and legally constituted organizations.  Organizations can act as agents --- specifically, group agents, not individuals (cf. Individual-Agent) --- to undertake projects, enter into agreements, own property, etc.   Most organizations have names.  Almost all have at least two members. Examples: Cycorp, NASA, Free-Software-Foundation, United-States-Army, K-Mart-Company.  Note the specialization Organization-Of-People, whose instances have only human members, e.g., an instance of Family-Human such as Joseph Kennedy's family.  Other kinds of Organization have organizations as their Group-Members, e.g., the Organization-Of-American-States.

         A collection of attributes.  Each element of Physical-Structural-Attribute is a physical attribute that determines or describes the structure of a tangible object.  These attributes are qualitative, not measurable; in that way, they are unlike those described by the elements of Density, Mass, Elasticity, Thermal-Conductivity, and other attributes which belong to Scalar-Interval.  Examples of Physical-Structural-Attribute: Granular, Powdery, Paste-Form, Brittle, Collapsible, Hollow, Woven, Burnt.   An individual object's Physical-Structural-Attributes are indicated with the predicate Physical-Structural-Attributes.

         A collection of organizations.  An element of Military-Organization is an organization whose function (and expertise) is the use of armed force, or the threat of such use, against enemies, especially other organized, armed enemies.  A military organization includes its fighting forces and their command structure, together with dedicated support services controlled by that military command.  Typically, there are special conditions in the relationships between a Military-Organization and its workers, going beyond what is expected of work agreements in civilian settings, including strict sanctions to enforce obedience.  This collection includes Government-Military-Organizations such as the armies, navies, air forces, etc., of the world's governments, and in addition private armies, rebel armies, and organized mercenary units.

      <rdfs:comment>
         The most generic collection of events in which Money changes hands.  Thus, in an instance of Money-Transfer, there is some way in which money transfers possession -- though `ownership' of the funds may or may not be transferred from and/or to the agents involved.  E.g., an ATM withdrawal from the user's own account, a utility payment made at one's local grocery store, buying a newspaper, getting change for a dollar from a cashier, are all examples of Money-Transfer events.  Compare this collection with its subset Money-Transaction; in money Transactions, which are also elements of Commercial-Activity, not only is there a transfer of money, but it is done as part of an agreement (explicit or implicit) between the two participating agents that one will do something for the other -- something more than bookkeeping -- contingent upon the transfer of funds.

         The collection of mathematical sets.  An element of Set-Mathematical can be any arbitrary set, including sets whose members have nothing in common.  In contrast, the members of an instance of Set-Mathematical's sibling Collection (q.v.) all have some important, natural properties in common.  Sets and collections also differ in that there cannot exist two distinct sets that have exactly the same elements.  A third point of contrast between sets and collections is that rarely will it be desirable to create a new constant to refer to a set.  Instead, a set will either be intensionally specified by a defining property, using The-Set-Of, as in (The-Set-Of ?X (Likes-As-Friend Lenat ?X)), or extensionally specified by listing its elements, using The-Set, as in (The-Set 3 4 5).  (In certain cases, a set will be extensionally specified by means of one of the more specialized functions The-Partition or The-Covering.  See Partitioned-Into and Covering.)

Writing a check or offering a credit card in payment are First-Sub-Events of paying events; such payings are successful only if the check is not lost or stolen, if it clears the bank, etc.  On the other hand, filling out a pledge card, e.g., for United Way, is NOT considered a Paying event or part of one, because it does not involve or initiate any legal reassignment of rights to the money.

         A collection of tangible things. 
 Each Physical-Device is an Artifact which is designed 
for a specific use or 
to perform a specific function. 
Thus, the collections Tool, Condom, Bath-Tub, and
Transportation-Device-Vehicle are all subsets of this
collection, as are many other collections. Excluded are
artifacts which can only be 'used' in a very loose or
metaphorical sense, such as instances of Sculpture,
Flower-Bed, or Advertisement. Also, an instance of 
Physical-Device should have a relatively rigid, set
shape (which doesn't exclude it having moving parts!);

An element of Food-Service-Organization is a business which prepares and/or serves food as its major function(s).  Important subsets of Food-Service-Organization include Restaurant and Catering-Company.  Note that grocery stores -- and airlines -- are not themselves considered elements of Food-Service-Organization, even though some of those may have Sub-Organizations or sub-contractors which are#$FoodServiceOrganizations.  Bars or taverns, in contrast to Restaurants that also prepare and serve food, are also not considered Food-Service-Organizations.

         Daytime-Working-Hours is a set of time intervals.  The length of each of those intervals, and their Starting-Point and Ending-Point, are defined by the bulk of a working population performing their daily jobs.  The schedule varies by context -- i.e. which group of workers are being considered -- and the boundaries are fuzzy.  This fuzziness makes the concept more useful in many ways, though, not less useful.

         State-Of-Matter-Solid-Liquid-Gaseous is the collection of attributes which describe the basic physical states that pieces of matter can be in.  Elements of this collection are Solid-State-Of-Matter, Semi-Solid-State-Of-Matter, Liquid-State-Of-Matter, and Gaseous-State-Of-Matter.  Although the chemical composition of a substance does not change when its basic physical state changes, many of its intrinsic physical properties do change--including its density, viscosity, brittleness, color, size, etc.  In addition, changing the basic state of pieces of certain compounds may alter their chemical composition (e.g., using distillation to separate alcohol from other fluids) and as a result may effect toxicity and other biological factors.

      </Name-In-Cyc>
      <rdfs:comment>
         Sibling-Disjoint-Collection captures a very important concept, but one that is rarely given a name.  There are many sets of sets for which any two member sets either will be disjoint (i.e., have no intersection) or else one will be a subset of the other.  For instance, consider the various types (i.e., sets) of animals in the usual Linnaean taxonomy:  Vertebrate, Bird, Dog, Mammal, Invertebrate, Person, etc.; Vertebrates and Invertebrates are mutually disjoint, while Bird, Mammal, Dog, and Person are all subsets of Vertebrate.  Dog and Person are disjoint with each other, but each of them is a subset of Vertebrate.  All of the Linnaean sets, or collections, of animals can be grouped together into one set, or collection, of sets, which in turn is an instance of Sibling-Disjoint-Collection.   
It turns out that the real situation --- and the real definition of Sibling-Disjoint-Collection --- is slightly more complicated than that.  Consider types of appliances: toasters, cars, shavers, clocks, etc.  Is the set of such appliance-types a Sibling-Disjoint-Collection, the way we defined it above, for types of animals?  Almost, but not quite.  One could have an appliance-type `ClockRadio', which would be the set of all clock radios, and clearly each clock radio is both a clock and a radio, yet neither Clock nor Radio-Receiver is a subset of the other.  So if we have some item that purports to be both a clock and radio, that is okay if one of the following three conditions is met:
(1) the collection Clock is known to be a subset of Radio-Receiver;
(2) the collection Radio-Receiver is known to be a subset of Clock;
(3) there is already defined a collection X which is a subset of both Clock and Radio-Receiver.
More formally, the axiom that defines Sibling-Disjoint-Collection is as follows: SIB is an element of Sibling-Disjoint-Collection if and only if:
(:=&gt;
   (:and 
       (:Direct-Types C1 SIB) 
       (:Direct-Types C2 SIB) (:Direct-Types C1-EL C1)
       (Different C1 C2))
   (:or 
       (:not (:Direct-Types C1-EL C2)) 
       (:Exists C3 (:and (:Direct-Superclasses C3 C2) (:Direct-Superclasses C3 C1) (:Direct-Types C1-EL C3)))))
That axiom, together with the minimization of :Direct-Superclasses, gives us the following characterization of our concept:  If we have a collection SIB that is an element of Sibling-Disjoint-Collection, and if we take two elements C1 and C2 of that collection SIB, then each element of C1 which is not an element of a common specialization (C3) of C1 and C2, MUST NOT BE an element of C2.
In cases where there are a few exceptions --- that is, a couple of elements of SIB might have some overlap --- but it is undesirable to explicitly create a new reified constant (like `ClockRadio', above) for that intersection, Cyc allows you to use an explicit mechanism to override the Sibling-Disjoint-Collection constraints for a particular C1 and C2; namely, you would assert to Cyc (Sibling-Disjoint-Exceptions C1 C2).  See also Sibling-Disjoint-Exceptions.

         The collection of all quasiordered sets (also called quasiorders, semiorders, quosets or pseudo-ordered sets), each being a Set-With-Structure consisting of a set together with a quasiordering relation on that set.   Mathematical Partially-Ordered-Sets, including directed chains, trees, forests, and lattices, are special cases of Quasi-Ordered-Set, but unlike the former, Quasi-Ordered-Sets can have relational cycles.  The quasiordering relation is defined on the associated set, and is transitive on that set and reflexive on that set (it need not be antisymmetric, asymmetric or symmetric on that set).   Sometimes the members of the Quasi-Ordered-Set are called its nodes, and the non-redundant (transitively reduced) pairwise relations between the nodes are called its links.  A Quasi-Ordered-Set may be finite or infinite, and connected or unconnected.  (Note: A Quasi-Ordered-Set is not a Set-Or-Collection, rather it is a Set-With-Structure that has an associated Set-Or-Collection.)

         Each Holiday is an Event wherein social celebrations and/or rituals are performed, typically lasting for one Days-Duration and typically coinciding with a Calendar-Day.  While Holidays are often Annual-Events, they may also be one-time events or scheduled in some other manner.  They are also contextual, as different nationalities, eras, etc. celebrate different ones.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of collections; a subset of Tangible-Stuff-Composition-Type.  Every instance of Chemical-Compound-Type is a subset of Tangible-Thing whose instances are defined ONLY by their chemical composition, and not by their physical state or any other property.  In Cyc's current representation, Chemical-Compound-Types can be of two varieties:  (1) Collections whose instances are completely uniform with each other in terms of chemical composition; this includes (a) the chemical elements -- such as Carbon, Oxygen, and Hydrogen -- which are instances of Element-Stuff-Type-By-Number-Of-Protons (thus, the latter is a subset of Chemical-Compound-Type), and (b) compounds constituted of more than one substance chemically bonded, e.g., Water, Caffeine, and Iron-Oxide.  (2) Substances which have a general chemical specification, that is, whose instances do not have exactly the same chemical composition but fall within certain specifications, e.g., DNA.  Cyc's current theory includes those cases in Chemical-Compound-Type, though they are arguably borderline.  (Future work may require the creation of type collections to identify various levels of chemical specification, such as `exact formula' or `exact structure'.)
Note: Collections which Cyc does NOT classify as Chemical-Compound-Types include collections of substances which have some component which is of overriding significance in some context, so that in everyday language such substances are frequently referred to by the name of their important component (e.g., `penicillin' applied to a tablet containing penicillin), but which have significant admixtures of other substances.  Our representation distinguishes between the chemical compound (here, instances of Penicillin) and the mixture of substances in a tablet containing some Penicillin for pharmaceutical use.  Thus, Penicillin is an instance of Chemical-Compound-Type, but the collection of tablets containing penicillin and including other ingredients are not.  Also, subsets of Mixture, such as Lemonade, are not instances of Chemical-Compound-Type, because mixtures are determined by their physical state rather than solely by their chemical composition.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of events; a subset of Movement-Translation-Event.  In an instance of Locomotion-Event, the Object-Moving (at least the object that is playing the role of Done-By in the event) moves along some pathway under its own power (i.e. plays the role of Provider-Of-Motive-Force).  In addition to episodes of walking and swimming, Locomotion-Event includes events in which an agent moves itself using a device, with that agent supplying the motive force to the device -- as in instances of Pedaling-A-Bicycle, Ice-Skating, In-Line-Skating, etc.  Since the locomotor virtually always supplies the vast majority of the force required to make the motion happen, it is safe to infer that IF something plays the role of Provider-Of-Motive-Force, THEN it is an Object-Moving.  In certain abnormal situations this rule will make the wrong conclusions: e.g. if a mountain climber's assent is aided by another stationary person above.  Some locomotion events are also transportation events, e.g. when someone is walking while carrying something else.
Note: Elements of Locomotion-Event may be `non-homogeneous' (by contrast, each Locomotion-Process is `homogeneous.')  That is, if you take Time-Slices of a Locomotion-Event, they may or may not be Locomotion-Events.  E.g., even though a mountain-climbing event is a Locomotion-Event, if you take a time-slice of it  -- even a quite long time-slice of it! -- that whole time-slice could be where you were tying your climbing rope to a piton you'd just pounded into the mountainside, and that tying event is not a Locomotion-Event.  Note that this is not quite the same thing as the granularity of a process, such as Animal-Walking-Process, where if you take a fine enough time-slice you are just lifting your leg up into the air.  In the case of a Locomotion-Event such as scaling a sheer rock wall, very little of the time actually involves the motion of your body up the wall.

         The collection of all Cyc functions whose values can be reified and treated like Cyc constants.  Using reifiable functions allow us to add to the KB efficiently; e.g., (Government-Fn France) can be treated more or less the same as if we had created a new constant term called `GovernmentOfFrance', and Government-Fn can be applied to any element of Geopolitical-Entity to produce such a reified term representing the region's government.  On the other hand, it is not desirable to reify every non-atomic term; for example, all the measurable quantities, such as (Inch 5), and the numbers which result from using elements of Function-From-Quantities-To-Quantities (e.g., Plus-Fn).  Thus, Individual-Denoting-Function does not and should NOT have Reifiable-Function as a :Direct-Superclasses, because Individual-Denoting-Function includes the elements of Unit-Of-Measure and other functions whose uses we don't want to reify.  See also Non-Predicate-Function, Reifiable-Term.

         A collection of collections.  Each element of Tangible-Stuff-State-Type is a collection of all pieces of tangible stuff that are associated with only a single physical state (i.e., structural phase).  This includes collections both (1) of substances which exist only in one state (e.g., Diamond) and (2) of stuff which by definition has a certain state (e.g., ice, or gels of any composition).  Thus, ice, water vapor, and liquid water--i.e., (Liquid-Fn Water)--would be represented by a Tangible-Stuff-State-Type.  Water itself, however, can exist in all three states; thus, the collection Water, which includes all instances of water regardless of state, is NOT a Tangible-Stuff-State-Type.  Elements of Tangible-Stuff-State-Type include the collections Solid-Tangible-Thing, Air, Powder, Gel, Paste, and many others.  Any of the Cyc functions Solid-Fn, Liquid-Fn, or Gaseous-Fn can be used to create a collection which :Direct-Types Tangible-Stuff-State-Type.

         A collection of geographical regions.  Each element of Ecological-Region is a region having one or more characteristic ecosystems.  From knowledge of those ecosystems, we can posit whether certain organisms can forage, reproduce, and live successfully there.  Information about ecological regions typically also includes what kinds of organisms are in fact found there.  In theory, any arbitrary continuous region could be analyzed as an ecological region, but most regions identified in practice have some kind of sameness or systematic interconnection in their topology, climate, and biology.  Examples: the Western-Desert-Of-Egypt, the Great-Barrier-Reef, the Amazon-Region.

         A collection of collections.  Each element of each element of Existing-Object-Type is temporally stufflike yet is objectlike in other ways, e.g., spatially.  Any one of many Time-Slices of a copy of `Moby Dick' sitting on your shelf is still a copy of `Moby Dick' sitting on your shelf.  Most tangible objects are temporally stufflike in this fashion.   That book is, of course, not spatially stufflike; spatially, it is objectlike:  if we take a scalpel and slice the book into ten pieces, each piece is not a copy of `Moby Dick'.   So (:Direct-Types Book Existing-Object-Type) is true, because each book is temporally stufflike but spatially objectlike. See the comment for Stuff-Type to find out more about the distinctions between, and the need for, these four collections: Stuff-Type, Object-Type, Existing-Stuff-Type, and Existing-Object-Type.

         The collection of microtheories that are each assumed to include at least one counterfactual assertion: an assertion which is believed to be untrue in the real world.  It may be, however, that there is no explicit counterfactual assertion in a given Counterfactual-Context.  In particular, it is not required that there be any explicit contradiction of assertions in the Genl-Mts of the Counterfactual-Context.  But intuitively speaking, most adults would be reticent about trusting too strongly in a propositon whose only justification was in a Counterfactual-Context.  All works of fiction relate events that transpire in counterfactual contexts.  Examples:  World-Mythology-Mt, Paddington-Bear-Stories-Mt, Christmas-Mythology-Mt.

         A collection of corporations; a subset of both Legal-Corporation and Non-Profit-Organization.  An element of Non-Profit-Corporation is a Legal-Corporation which is engaged in non-profit or not-for-profit activities.  Typically, (unlike commercial corporations,) non-profit corporations have no shareholders or owners, although they are commonly governed by a board (cf. Board-Of-Directors).  Many non-profit organizations are incorporated, including charities, political action groups, clubs, and political parties.  Most have official non-profit standing with a government.  Because they are non-profit organizations, non-profit corporations do not pay corporate income taxes.  For the broader class of non-profit entities, see Non-Profit-Organization.

         The collection of human beings old enough to participate as independent, mature members of society.  Since different societies have different age or maturity requirements for people to be considered adults, different axioms in various society-specific microtheories express these requirements.  For most modern, Western, middle-class,... purposes, e.g., the current view is that anyone over 18 is an adult.  In many cultures, adulthood occurs when one reaches puberty.  Adulthood is Contiguous-After childhood; that is, a Person is a Human-Child for a while, and then is a Human-Adult.

         The collection of all things that have a spatial extent or location relative to some other Spatial-Thing.  Note well that to say that an entity is a member of this collection is to remain agnostic about two issues.  First, a Spatial-Thing may be Partially-Tangible, like Texas-State or wholly Intangible, like the Arctic-Circle or a line or a plane referenced in a geometric theorem.  Second, although we do insist on location relative to another Spatial-Thing, a Spatial-Thing may or may not be located in the physically observable universe.  It is far from clear that all Spatial-Things are so located:  eg, a trajectory through the phase space of some physical system.  If the intent is to imply location in the empirically observable cosmos, the user should employ this collection's spec, Spatial-Thing-Localized.

All that matters is that the instances of that type (i.e., collection) of stuff are entirely composed of atoms having a particular number of protons in each atomic nucleus.  Thus, the collection Carbon is an instance of Element-Stuff-Type-By-Number-Of-Protons, but neither the collection Diamond nor the collection Graphite is (even though they are subsets of Carbon), because their members have additional qualifications.

         This is a subset of :Slot (hence the anachronistic `Slot' in its name).  It is also a subset of Cotemporal-Predicate.  Frankly, it is really just the intersection of Cotemporal-Predicate and :Slot, so it is strictly speaking superfluous, but has proven itself to be useful.  Suppose predicate P is an instance of Cotemporal-Objects-Slot.  If (P X Y) holds, then it must be the case that (Cotemporal X Y).  For example, consider the binary predicate Owns, which is an instance of Cotemporal-Objects-Slot.  To represent `Nick owned Spot in 1992' we could create the appropriate cotemporal subabstractions of each, and assert (Owns NickIn1992 SpotIn1992), and this would satisfy the constraint introduced when we declared Owns to be a Cotemporal-Objects-Slot.  More tersely, we could use Holds-In (qv) and just assert (Holds-In (Year-Fn 1992) (Owns Nick Spot)), since Holds-In implicitly treats instances of Something-Existing as their appropriate subabstractions.  Alternatively, we could create a context (a microtheory) one of whose assumptions was a temporal one, limiting all axioms to holding during 1992, and then in that context we could simply assert (Owns Nick Spot).  But it would be incorrect to assert (Owns Nick Spot) in the Base-KB, since Nick as a baby and Nick as an old man didn't/won't own Spot.

Examples include a news broadcast program, a court trial, inheriting property, writing a letter, a physical examination, a charity ball, traffic on some section of highway during rush hour.  Note that this collection does NOT imply that the events which are its instances have doers (see Done-By).

         A collection of tangible stuff; a subset of Edible-Stuff.  Each element of Food-Ingredient-Only is an edible substance that is used in making other food but isn't eaten by itself.  These may or may not require some preparation.  For example, Table-Salt, Vegetable-Oil, and Ketchup are subsets of Food-Ingredient-Only, because all of their instances are used only as ingredients or condiments.   In contrast, Egg-Chickens is not a subset of Food-Ingredient-Only; some of its instances serve as ingredients in cooking other dishes, (and those instances are elements of Food-Ingredient-Only,) but other eggs are simply eaten after poaching or frying (and those instances belong to the collection Food, not Food-Ingredient-Only).  Types of foodlike Pizza, whose instances are never merely ingredients, are just subsets of Food.

         A collection of events; a subset of Taking-Something.  In an instance of Stealing-Generic, one Agent takes a possession of another agent's without the owner's permission (and possibly without the owner's knowledge).  Stealing is commonly considered criminal in most contexts.
Note:  It is not the case that every use of another's things without explicit permission is categorized as an instance of Stealing-Generic.  An informal agreement or `understanding' may exist between Agents that would cover casual `borrowing' (and excuse it from being stealing); the closer the relationship the more expensive and personal the items that fall into such an exclusion.  E.g., even if I am in a perfect stranger's office, and they have left for a minute, I feel it is not stealing to take one of their Kleenexes if I am about to sneeze.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of Cyc predicates.  Each element of Cotemporal-Predicate is a Cyc predicate whose temporal arguments (i.e., arguments having a temporal extent) must be Cotemporal, i.e., they have the same temporal starting points and ending points.  Moreover, all the temporal arguments of all the cotemporal predicates involved in a single axiom must be Cotemporal.  Since this is a very common and important relationship, we'll consider a detailed example.   If I say `Fred owns a Camaro', what I really mean is that some Sub-Abstrac (i.e., a time-slice) of Fred, over some time interval INT (e.g., 1993-1995), owns some Sub-Abstrac of that Camaro, which exists over that very same time interval INT.  Fred may have owned many cars before and since, and that Camaro may have had many owners before and since, but one time-slice of Fred owned one time-slice of that car.  Common sense tells us that the time interval (INT) must have been the same in both cases; Cyc can infer this commonsensical conclusion from our having told it that Owns is a cotemporal relation, i.e., (:Direct-Types Owns Cotemporal-Predicate).  A ternary example is `between', as in `Lucy is between Fred and Ethel'.  Not all predicates are elements of Cotemporal-Predicate, of course; consider `remembers' -- I (today) remember my father as he was forty years ago.  There are some borderline cases here; Sees clearly belongs to Cotemporal-Predicate, but in the case of someone smelling another object (cf. Smells) it is less clearcut, since one can smell an object that has ceased to exist.

involves one or more formatted data record schemes, 
together with some device for searching and retrieving data.  
Note that, as an IBO, a Database-Physical is some particular,
tangible copy of a database. To refer to the abstract 'content'
of a database, use Database-Abstract-Content.

         A collection of events.  Each element of Cooking-Food is an event in which some item of Food is prepared by heating it.  Typically, the foodstuff is heated until it reaches a certain temperature over some period of time, during which chemical and/or physical changes occur which are supposed to make the foodstuff healthier or tastier (or, in some cases, ethically acceptable).  A Cooking-Food event may last from a few minutes (e.g., Steaming-Food (vegetables), Making-Toast) to several hours (e.g., Roasting-Food).  
Note:  Smoking-Food is not a subset of Cooking-Food.  Food prepared by smoking (e.g., smoked ham, bacon) is `cured' by a chemical reaction with nitrates in the smoke, rather than being cooked by heat.  Cf. Smoking-Food, Salting-Food.

         The collection of all existing objects that are commonly paths, or are normally used as paths or conduits for people, animals, vehicles, material or information.  A Path-Customary is either designed as a path or it has a significant known function as a path for movement.  Examples include roads, railroads, sea-lanes, cowpaths, boardwalks, tubes, channels, blood vessels, fibers, wires, communication links, etc.   It does not include all the things that may be used as paths in some particular Path-Systems, but are otherwise not ordinarily viewed as paths (though the latter are still instances of Path-Generic).  If a Path-Customary is an instance of a certain Path-Type, it may be assumed to be part of a system (not necessarily explictly given) of such paths.  Or, on the other hand, it may be asserted to be part of a particular specified Path-System using the predicate Path-In-System.  A Path-Customary is either a Path-Simple (with two distinct ends, not forming a cycle) or else it may be a Path-Cyclic.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of events.  Each element of Communicating is an event in which the transfer of information between or among agents is a focal action; communicating is the main purpose and/or goal in the event.  That may be contrasted with events which involve communication but wherein the focus is different, e.g., playing cards (wherein the progressive actions--and winning--of the game are focal).  
Communicating may be either a one-way or a two-way transfer of information (cf. Communication-Act-Single, Multi-Directional-Communication).  It may be intentional or unintentional.  Every event belonging to Communicating contains at least one transfer of information between at least two agents who participate in the event.  (Note that the latter requirement excludes reading and writing from Communicating, when those events are just the private accessing or generating of information.)  
Communicating may be specialized in various ways, such as, by the method or medium used (e.g., Audio-Communicating, Non-Verbal-Communicating, Face-To-Face-Presence-Communicating); by the type of information involved (e.g., Making-An-Agreement); by the purpose of the communication (e.g., Teaching, Negotiating); by the agents involved (e.g., Intra-Organization-Communication, Stage-Production).  Examples of Communicating include a symphony performance, an email message, a telephone call, a speech, a handshake, issuing a traffic ticket--all of which normally, and focally, involve communication between two or more agents.

This includes both purely topographical regions like mountains and underwater spaces, and those defined by demographics, e.g., countries and cities.  In all cases, though, note that the 'region' in question must contain some tangible component with which it is possible to make physical contact.  The elements of Geographical-Region contrast in this respect with the elements of Geographical-Thing-Intangible, which are wholly 'imaginary'.  Examples of Geographical-Regions: City-Of-Pittsburgh-PA, Rocky-Mountain-States-US-Region, the Bahamas, Yale-University, Sinai-Peninsula.  Some important types of regions are represented by the subsets Geopolitical-Entity, Language-Area, Time-Zone, Postal-Code-Region, Ecological-Region, Construction-Site.  No elements of Geographical-Region are wholly indoor locations.

         A collection of physical devices.  An instance of Weapon is a device primarily designed for destructive action against animals (often against other sentient beings, most often humans) and/or their habitats (or, more rarely, some class of possessions of theirs.)  This collection includes weapons as traditionally defined (e.g., instances of Sword, instances of Gun-Portable, Bombs, etc.) and also miscellaneous military vehicles and hardware used to kill, to destroy, to immobilize, etc. in military operations (such as the elements of Warplane, Modern-Naval-Ship, Tank-Vehicle, etc.)
Note that in the case of missile weapons, both the launcher and the ammunition are considered Weapons in this sense.  E.g., a bow, an arrow, a missile launcher, an ICBM missile, a gun, a bullet.  This may seem odd at first glance, but in many contexts most of the same axioms apply to both.  Even in our linguistic utterances this carries over; e.g., if asked what killed JFK we can say a rifle, or a bullet from a rifle.  Of course there are specializations (subsets) of Weapon that limit themselves to `the real weapon itself' and to `ammunition for missile weapons.'

      <rdfs:comment>
         For a measurable non-negative quantity, the ordered sequence of possible values may be thought of as a line. Non-Negative-Scalar-Intervals are the line segments (or points) on such a line,  representing a range of consecutive values, all equal to or greater than 0.  The most common case is where the line is just the non-negative part of the Real Number Line, and in fact where the Non-Negative-Scalar-Interval is either a contiguous set of points there (i.e., a range of numbers) or just a single point there (i.e., a number). Another common case is where the line has some unit of measure marked off, such as meters.

      <rdfs:comment>
         The collection of all mathematical sets and all collections.  Instances of Set-Mathematical and instances of Collection share some basic common features.  They are both abstract entities, lacking spatial and temporal properties.  More specifically, they (can) have elements, and hence may stand to one another in set-theoretic relations such as Subset-Of and Disjoint-With.  Nevertheless, sets and collections differ in two important respects.  Every collection is associated with an intensional criterion for membership -- a more or less natural property or group of properties possessed by its members.  (The criterion for membership need not, and often will not, be precisely definable in any language.)  Collections are thus akin to kinds.  In contrast, the elements of a set are not required to be homogeneous in any respect; any things whatsoever may together comprise the members of a set.  The second major difference between sets and collections is that no two distinct sets can be co-extensional (be such that every element of one is an element of the other and conversely).  Sets are, so to speak, identified on the basis of their extensions.  Collections, on the other hand, are identified by their intensional criteria for membership.  So collections which have exactly the same elements may be distinct, differing in their respective membership criteria.

Actions may include any event in which one or more actor(s) effect some change(s) in the tangible or intangible state of the world, typically by some expenditure of effort or energy.  But note that it is not required that any tangible object be moved, changed, produced, or destroyed for an action to occur; the effects of actions may be intangible (such as the change in a bank balance, or the intimidation of a subordinate).  Depending upon the context, actors may be animate or inanimate, conscious or nonconscious.  For actions that are intentional, see also Purposeful-Action, Performed-By.

Another marginal positive example is a stylus designed to held in the mouth by a quadraplegic person; i.e., `hand-held' is not an absolutely hard and fast constraint here.  A close NON-example is a handheld calculator.

The maindifference between this collection and the collection#$TransportingGoods is that there are human beings as Main-Transportees in instances of Transporting-People, while thereare no human beings as Main-Transportees in instances of#$TransportingGoods.

         A collection of information bearing objects (IBOs).  Each element of Computer-Program is an IBO, i.e., a tangible object which contains intangible information, namely instructions written in a code readable by some computer system and which are intended for execution by a computer.  The tangible component of a computer program may be embodied in the memory of a particular instance of Computer (during a particular time), in a static magnetic medium (e.g., a disk or tape), in a hardcopy, even (once upon a time) in a set of punch cards.  Again, note that elements of Computer-Program are physically embodied programs, which rightly interpreted yield the information and/or instructions in the program.  The elements of Algorithm and of Character-String (which are abstract) are NOT elements of Computer-Program, although they may figure in the intangible components of a computer program.

         A collection of collections.  Each element of Formal-Product-Type is a collection of products (i.e., tangible products, services, information products, etc.), all of which conform to a standardized product specification (i.e., a `form').  In Western-style capitalistic markets, elements of Formal-Product-Type are often associated with a particular brand name (and perhaps model), since competing providers of products design them to be distinctive.  For example, the collection Internal-Combustion-Engine is not an element of Formal-Product-Type, but a specific collection of engines manufactured by (e.g.) Mazda would be.  On the service side, the collection Hair-Cutting-Event is not a Formal-Product-Type, but a subset of hair stylings for men (e.g., at a particular designer's salon) might be.

A city government is usually mostly autonomous from the governments of its surrounding regions, rather than being a sub-organization of them.

         The collection of all animal torsos.  A torso is the main portion of the animal's body, generally located centrally,
and one can conceive of an animal as a torso to which are connected the head and various appendages which together make up the entire animal.

         A collection of mental events, a subset of Perceiving. Each element of this collection is a perceptual event in which the agent involuntarily receives senory information. Thus, if I am in a room, and a light is turned on, I would see the light reflected off of the walls, but without any effort on my part.  On the other hand, actively searching for something with my eyes would not be a member of this collection.

         A collection of places.  Each Human-Occupation-Construct is a place where people do things, such as: the Empire State Building, an individual office in that building, the White House, the Lincoln Bedroom in the White House, an elevator, a tent, etc.

An instance of Human-Occupation-Construct is an artificial construction belonging to the collection Container-Product, and its Primary-Function is as a place in which humans perform activities.  Some large subsets include 
   (a) instances of Human-Shelter-Construction (e.g., houses); 
   (b) sub-regions within a Human-Shelter-Construction or within any building which are intended for human use (e.g., rooms, shower stalls), and 
   (c) regions in any transportation vehicle which are designed for human occupancy (e.g., the cockpit, passenger compartment).  

Note:  Some buildings which are not themselves instances of Human-Occupation-Construct, such as Hoover-Dam, may have a sub-region which is a Human-Occupation-Construct (e.g., the control room at the top of the dam).

Note:  The collection Human-Occupation-Construct is broad enough to include tents, boiler rooms, elevator shafts, steam tunnels, and the space inside the Lincoln-Memorial-In-Washington-DC.  Thus, an instance of Human-Occupation-Construct need not be strictly Indoors (q.v.), since Indoors is meant to include many characteristics that those places do not necessarily share (such as humanly comfortable temperature, lighting at night, not terribly noisy or windy, clean).  We therefore do not make the default assertion that a Human-Occupation-Construct is Indoors; however, an instance of Human-Occupation-Construct is certainly not a purely Outdoor-Location (q.v.), so we DO assert that those two collections are disjoint.  Certain subsets of Human-Occupation-Construct, however, do have `indoor' characteristics, and so we assert (for example) that anything found inside instances of Room-In-A-Construction or Modern-Shelter-Construction is found Indoors.  Note:  For places designed to be occupied by humans but which are purely outdoor locations (such as elements of Lawn, Parking-Lot, and Playground), see Humanly-Occupied-Spatial-Object.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of `objects' with temporal extent.  Each element of Agreement involves two or more parties, who agree that certain propositions should be true.  Making the propositions true may require some action or commitment of wealth on the part of one or more of the Agreeing-Agents.  Thus, elements of Agreement will usually involve some instances of Obligation.
Note:  Elements of Agreement and Obligation differ, however, in that an Obligated-Agent is responsible for the truth of all of the propositions in an obligation.  In an agreement, some agents may not be responsible for all of the propositions in the agreement being true. For example, in a loan agreement, the borrower agrees to give the lender back the money, but the borrower is the only Obligated-Agent for the repayment.  Note that Obligated-Agents need not be among the Agreeing-Agents in the agreement that involves or generates the obligation.  For example, the Board of Directors of XYZCorporation may agree that some non-director will assume the post and duties of President of XYZCorporation.  Moreover, Agreeing-Agents aren't always obligatedAgents; e.g., Wanda and Paul may agree that Paul alone is obligated to do some task.
Examples include instances of Peace-Accord, Legal-Agreement, Informal-Agreement, Business-Partnership-Agreement, Work-Agreement, Sales-Agreement, Maintenance-Agreement, Reservation, Appointment, etc.

         Unit-Of-Measure is the collection of all functions which return elements of Scalar-Interval that describe physical quantities such as Speed, Volume, etc.  Those functions are usually grouped into subsets depending on what they measure (e.g., Unit-Of-Speed,Unit-Of-Volume).  Functions which belong to Unit-Of-Measure are variable-arity relations that take either one or two arguments, both of which must be elements of Real-Number. If only one argument is given (e.g. (Meter 5)), the expression stands for a precise quantity (here, 5 meters); see also Scalar-Point-Value.  If two arguments are given (e.g. (Meter 5 10)), the expression stands for a closed interval and the arguments are interpreted as the interval's mininum and maximum, respectively. Following are a few example uses of some elements of Unit-Of-Measure:







     `10 years': (Years-Duration 10) 



     `2 feet': (Foot-Unit-Of-Measure 2) 



     `50 dollars and 2 cents': (Dollar-United-States 50.02) 



     `between 1 and 50 pounds per square inch, inclusive': (Pounds-Per-Square-Inch 1 50) 



     `dimensionless quantity between 3 and 4.1, inclusive': (Unity 3 4.1).

All mammals other than the Monotremes of Australia bear live young rather than laying eggs and have teats, which on females are used for nursing the young.  Monotremes do not have teats, but both male and female produce milk from Mammary-Glands.   Mammal is an instance of Biological-Class.

      </Name-In-Cyc>
      <rdfs:comment>
         The collection of all microtheories, or `mts' for short.  Microtheories implement contexts in Cyc.  Each mt serves to group a set of assertions together that share some common assumptions.  Thus each mt can be thought of as having two parts: a corpus of assertions that represent the `content' of the mt, and a separate corpus of assertions that represent the `assumptions' which are being made.  E.g., in a normal modern everyday life microtheory, there might be hundreds of content assertions such as `drivers are at least 16 years old', and there might be dozens of assumption assertions about that microtheory's content, such as `all actors are assumed to be law-abiding'.   You can think of the assumptions as a set of extra conjuncts on the left hand side (the antecedent or `if'-part) of every content assertion in the mt.  

Each assertion in the knowledge base must be explicitly stated to be true in at least one mt.  It will then (by inference) also be true in all the more specialized contexts.  If something is true in the `life in North America' mt, then it should by default be true in the `life in Canada' mt.  I.e., the microtheories are organized into a generalization/specialization lattice by the predicate Subcontext-Of (q.v.), just as collections are organized into such a lattice by :Direct-Superclasses, and just as predicates are organized into such a lattice by Subrelation-Of.  Just as a collection may have several incommensurable supersets, so too a microtheory may have several incommensurable Genl-Mts.  Just as each and every collection must have some explicitly recorded superset (except for Thing), each and every mt must have some (expicitly recorded) more general mt (except for the Base-KB, which is the most general context, containing universal, timeless truths).  Just as a Cyc concept may have multiple incommensurable sets of which it is an element (via :Direct-Types), so too a Cyc assertion may be declared to be true in a set of incommensurable mts.

Every query is made in some mt, so the answer you get might very well depend on the mt in which you ask the question.  Let's call the current context C1, for the remainder of this paragraph.  The only assertions which can be used in C1 to answer the query are those assertions which were explicitly stated to be true in C1 or in some more general mt than C1.  But what if you want and need something like assertion P, to answer the question, but P doesn't fit that criterion, though P is true in some other mts that are unrelated to C1?  You can `import' or `lift' P into C1, by conjoining to its left hand side (if-part) the various assumptions of a context C999 in which P is known to be true.  I.e., what you actually conclude to be true in C1 is an assertion of the form `if a1 and a2 and... then P', where a1, a2,... are the assumptions of a context in which P holds (but which are NOT implied by assumptions of C1).  When there are several contexts to choose from, from which to import P, you will usually prefer the context whose assumptions are most similar to C1's assumptions, so there will be few extra conjuncts that need to be inserted in the `lifting' process.

There is an implicit third component to each Microtheory, namely the Cyc terms which are `known about' in that mt.  E.g., Lenat is not `known about' in a microtheory set in prehistoric times; Photochemical-Energy-Transduction is not `known about' in a microtheory representing things that a toddler believes to be true; etc.  Unlike the content and the assumptions, however, there is no need to explicitly collect into one list all the terms which are `known about'.  Rather, one could compute such a list by looking at all the terms which are mentioned anywhere in the content assertions of the mt.

Note that Microtheory is itself a `first-class object', as is each and every element of that collection --- e.g., Commercial-Buying-Mt, World-Geography-Mt, US-Healthcare-Mt, Human-Social-Life-Mt, etc.  The assertions about a Microtheory are just like any other Cyc assertions.  

Note that one important predicate we haven't mentioned here yet is the one that says `assertion P is true in microtheory M'.  That predicate is Ist.  Thus:  (Ist M P).

Note that another important predicate we haven't mentioned here yet is the one that says `microtheory M has the proposition P as a domain assumption'.  Thus: (Domain-Assumptions M P).

         A collection of collections.  Elements of Object-Type more or less correspond to count nouns in the following way: If COL is an element of Object-Type, and ITEM is any element of COL, then if you divide ITEM into two pieces, you do NOT generally end up with two elements of COL.  Another way of thinking of this is:  If you take several elements of COL, and put them together, the result is generally not another element of COL.  Sample instances of Object-Type are Automobile (the set of all cars);  Leap-Year (the set of all leap years).  See the comment for Stuff-Type to find out more about the distinctions between, and the need for, these four collections: Stuff-Type, Object-Type, Existing-Stuff-Type, and Existing-Object-Type.

         A collection of physical devices.  An instance of Information-Recording-Device is a device used for the recording of sensory information (i.e., audio and visual, but not encoded as character strings.)  So an instance would be your answering machine at home (an Answering-Machine), your cam-corder (a Video-Camera), but NOT your address book or your copy of the Yellow Pages.  
Note: A borderline case is a PDA (such as an Apple Newton) used to record handwritten script.  If it then processes that information and converts it to ASCII characters, it has stopped being an Information-Recording-Device in the currently intended sense.  Probably a better name for this concept, therefore, would be DeviceToRecordAnalogInformation.

         A collection of the lowest taxons (Biological-Taxon, q.v.) that are necessarily common to both parents of fertile offspring, or, in the case of asexual reproduction, necessarily common to parent and child.  Members of different species cannot produce fertile offspring by interbreeding.  An element of Biological-Species has members who all have significant traits in common, and members of each biological species have other members as parents.  In biological taxonomy, related species are grouped into a particular element of Biological-Genus (q.v.).

         The collection of all totally ordered sets (also called linearly ordered sets, strict linear orders, or directed chains), each being a Set-With-Structure consisting of a set together with an ordering relation on that set.   Mathematical lists, directed chains, finite sequences, infinite series, and number lines are special cases of Totally-Ordered-Set.  The ordering relation is defined on the associated set, and is transitive on that set, irreflexive on that set, and asymmetric on that set.   Sometimes the members of the Totally-Ordered-Set are called its nodes, and, for the discrete case, the pairwise relations between the adjacent nodes are called the links.  A Totally-Ordered-Set may be finite or infinite, and if infinite, it may or may not have a starting end.  (Note: A Totally-Ordered-Set is not a Set-Or-Collection, rather it is a Set-With-Structure that has an associated Set-Or-Collection.)

An element of Independent-Organization is an organization which is not affiliated with any Chain-Organization and that is not a sub-organization of any other Organization.  An independent organization is neither the top-level organization of a chain, nor a lower level organization in a chain, nor is it an element of Chain-Organization.  Note, however, that an Independent-Organization may have several locations within a small geographical region; e.g., Texas French Bread (a single, independent business) has multiple locations in Austin, TX.

         A collection of events.  In each Shattering-Event, something is destroyed by being broken into a mob of pieces. [A `mob' means `a large but indeterminate number']   Since the salient parts of the Inputs-Destroyed must be Brittle in order for this to happen, fluids (such as liquid water) and elastic stuff (such as rubber at room temperature) will generally not undergo any Shattering-Events.  Items which can be an Object-Acted-On in shattering events are typically made of glass, pottery, bone, plaster, etc.  Many substances, particularly solid metals and alloys, are extremely difficult to shatter.

         A collection of binary predicates.  Each element of Actor-Slot relates some instance of Event to a thing involved in that event (here called a `participant').  The first argument of every Actor-Slot is an instance of Event, and the second argument is an instance of Something-Existing, denoting a participant in that event.  Each specialized actor slot indicates HOW its participant participates in the event, i.e., in what role (e.g., Inputs, Outputs, Done-By).  `Participant' does NOT include the time of the event's occurrence, external representations of the event, and other more remotely related things that are not directly or indirectly `involved' in the occurrence of the event.

The clearest examples of Something-Existing are tangible things, like people, lakes, stars, the Earth's ionosphere, etc.  Some elements of Intangible, such as agreements and obligations, also exist stably in time over their lifetime (rather than `happening'), and thus both Agreement and Obligation are subsets of (i.e., have the :Direct-Superclasses) Something-Existing).

         A collection of information transfer events.  Each element of IBT-Generation is an event which creates some information-bearing thing--thus, an event in which some idea or information is expressed.  In elements of IBT-Generation, the particular IBT (i.e., element of Information-Bearing-Thing) which is created may be either a transient wave phenomenon (e.g., made of sound, light, or radio waves), or it may be a relatively long-lasting instance of Information-Bearing-Object (cf. IBO-Creation).  Humans frequently generate such IBTs as spoken language, gestures, and handwritten notes.  It is irrelevant for elements of IBT-Generation whether there is another agent who immediately (or, indeed, ever) accesses the resulting IBTs.  Note the difference: reading is NOT an IBT generation event, but writing (usually) is.  IBTs may be generated intentionally or unintentionally.  Also, every communication act starts with an instance of IBT-Generation.  See also: Communicating and its subsets, esp. Communication-Act-Single.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of non-cyclic paths, broadly conceived.  Each instance of Path-Simple has two ends and it forms a Path-Between them.  It can be a road, railroad, air lane, sea lane, channel, blood vessel, part of an electric circuit, part of a pipe system, or even some abstract chain of connections among people or a 'path' in Graph Theory.  A Path-Simple cannot cross itself, return to the same point, nor double back along itself.  Each Path-Simple has two distinct ends that do not 'overlap' each other.  But in general a path may have more than two things that are its 'end-points' -- for example, a path between Austin and Pittsburgh can also be a path between Texas and Pennsylvania.  In such an example Texas and Pennsylvania are required to be spatially disjoint.   (To prohibit multiple things being an end-point of a path simultaneously, specify a Path-System, because in a specified Path-System a path's two end points in the system are unique.  The predicate Path-Between-In-System is restricted to a set of paths and points specified for the particular Path-System.)  For a Path-Simple any points on it (e.g., Point-On-Path X PATH) are connected: 'Path-Connects' is true of them.  Any number of intersections may occur along a Path-Simple.   A path is different from a Traversal or a Trajectory: a traversal is the trace of an object moving along a path or in a Path-System, and the Traversal can cross itself and/or double back along itself any number of times.  While a path is fixed and may have no direction, a traversal has a particular direction.  Many distinct traversals may traverse the same underlying path (see Traversal and Traversal-In-System), since a traversal can go back and forth across the same part of a path any number of times.  A Trajectory (a trace of motion) along paths is a Traversal.

      <rdfs:comment>
         The collection of intentional social gatherings of people who have the same or similar purposes in attending, and in which there is communication between the participants.  E.g., a party, a conference, a wedding, etc.
Note:  A group of people waiting to board an elevator is not typically a Social-Gathering, even though they share a common purpose, since they are not expected to talk to each other.

         The collection of all edges on objects.  For a two-dimensional object, its boundaries other than corners are it edges.  For a three dimensional object the edges are the outer portions of those extremities, excluding any corners (Corner-2or3d), that are much more acute in cross section in one direction than in most other directions at the same point.  Some objects, like spheres, hairs, poles and typical burrs, have no edges.  A discus has one, round, edge; a typical sheet has four edges.  A mountain ridge might have only a single edge.  A solid polyhedron has six or more edges.

After the action, the IBO which is the Information-Destination of the update `has' the new information (i.e., Info-Added).  The resulting information content of that IBO includes both its content immediately prior to the addition, plus the newly added information.  Examples of Information-Adding: recording a check in the check register of one's checkbook; taking the next photograph on a roll of film; adding a new constant to the Cyc-KB.

Solutions are homogeneous, meaning that the composition at any one point in the Mixture is the same as that at any other point.  In contrast, a Suspension is a Mixture in which small discontinuous particles are surrounded by a continuous fluid.  Under normal conditions, the Solvent of every Solution has the State-Of-Matter Liquid-State-Of-Matter.  Thus Solutions also normally exhibit the properties of a liquid, since Solvents are Main-Constituents.  Exceptions to this include Gels, in which 'solid-like' properties of the Solution arise from the highly structured orientation of the Solute.  Examples of Solutions: a cup of coffee, a tincture of iodine, some vanilla extract.

Elements of Translation-Multi-Path include scattering, distributing, and collecting things.  E.g., all of the following exhibit multi-pathway translation movements: a rainshower or snowfall; an exploding firework; water being ejected from a sprinkling system; the surrounding objects being sucked up by a tornado; participants running a 100K footrace; pool balls during the opening break.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of events, Translation-Round-Trip is a subset of Translation-No-Location-Change.  Each element of Translation-Round-Trip represents one round trip event.  That is, an instance of Translation-Round-Trip is a complete translational movement that begins and ends in the same place (thus, the From-Location and To-Location are identical).  However, a round trip is usually a discontinuous motion (cf. Movement-Translation-Process).  In the simplest case, it has exactly one Outbound-Leg-Of-Round-Trip and exactly one Inbound-Leg-Of-Round-Trip, and the trip breaks at the Destination-Round-Trip, which is the place that the traveller visits in between the two legs of the journey.  Thus, in addition to a From-Location and To-Location, an instance of Translation-Round-Trip also has an Origin-Round-Trip and Destination-Round-Trip.  The Origin-Round-Trip is just the same as the From-Location and To-Location. 
For example, in Doug and Mary's trip to Antarctica, the Origin-Round-Trip was City-Of-Austin-TX, the Destination-Round-Trip was the Continent-Of-Antarctica.  Thus, the City-Of-Austin-TX was both the From-Location and the To-Location of the WHOLE (round) trip, and it was also the To-Location of the homeward leg of their trip (Inbound-Leg-Of-Round-Trip).   The Continent-Of-Antarctica was the To-Location for their Outbound-Leg-Of-Round-Trip and the From-Location of their homeward leg (i.e., their Inbound-Leg-Of-Round-Trip).
Note: to describe a multi-stop `round trip',  instead of using Translation-Round-Trip one can represent it as a circuit composed of a series of one-way legs.

         A collection of collections, a subset of Primitive-Attribute-Type.
Each element of Polar-Attribute-Type is a collection of 
attributes which can be possessed either to a positive or
to a negative degree. Thus, Electrical-Charge would be an
instance of this collection, whereas Wetness and Bed-Size
would not be.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of physical devices.  The set of Physical-Devices whose Primary-Function is to generate heat to raise the temperature of something else.  The stuff being heated might be gaseous (air in a room or a hair dryer), liquid (water in a pool or hot water tank), or solid (food in an oven, hair with a curling iron, plastic during its shaping, etc.)  An instance of Heating-Device typically has some energy input, some way of converting that energy to heat, and some way of delivering the heat to the object(s) to be heated.  A borderline positive example of this is a device which absorbs heat during warm periods such as daytimes, and radiates it back out again during cool periods such as nighttimes.  Note that heating must be a primary function of the device; no matter how little you think of your personal computer, it is not a Heating-Device.

      <rdfs:comment>
         Elements of the collection Format are attributes that are used to constrain the multi-valued nature of a Predicate.  Consider a predicate PRED which takes five arguments, and fix any four of those arguments -- say arguments 1, 2, 4, and 5.  The number of different legal values there can be for the third argument (given that we've already chosen the other four) is determined by which Format attribute has been specified for the 3rd argument place of PRED..





(1) If the Arg3-Format for PRED is Single-Entry, then there can be at most one single term that's legal (and thus at most one assertion), for those given values of arguments 1, 2, 4, and 5.  To illustrate, let's consider a predicate with a lower Arity, say (Mother CHILD MOM), which says that the mother of CHILD is MOM.  The Arg2-Format for Mother should be Single-Entry, since an animal can have only one biological mother.





(2) If the Arg3-Format of PRED is Set-The-Format, then there may be any number of assertions with different terms in the third argument position, but sharing the same values for arguments 1, 2, 4, and 5.  E.g., the Arg1-Format for Mother should be Set-The-Format, since a female can have multiple children.





(3) If the Arg3-Format of PRED is Interval-Entry, then there may be multiple assertions sharing the values of 1, 2, 4, and 5, but with different terms in the 3rd argument; however, all the values for the 3rd argument must be overlapping elements of Scalar-Interval (q.v.).  E.g., the height of a person might be specified in several ways, with slightly different margins of error (or approximation), which is fine, but all those alternate values had better have SOME overlap since the person really just has one particular true height at any given time.

         A collection of collections.  Each element of each element of Temporal-Object-Type is temporally object-like.  Take an element of Temporal-Object-Type -- say COL.  Take an element of that -- say OBJ.  Imagine making a videotape of OBJ.  Now play back just a small piece of that videotape.  It won't be an element of COL.  E.g., COL could be the set of events in which an orange is cut into quarters.  Say a videotape of that has been made of one such event, which lasted thirty seconds.  Now imagine some 5-second excerpt of that videotape.  That, in turn, is not a videotape of someone cutting up an orange into four pieces.  So the collection of all orange-quartering events is itself an element of Temporal-Object-Type; it is NOT an element of Temporal-Stuff-Type (q.v.).



If a collection COL :Direct-Types Temporal-Object-Type, it is reasonable to state axioms about temporally extrinsic properties of COL's instances -- properties such as duration, distance, cost, etc.  E.g., it makes sense to talk about the Duration of a particular Event in which an orange is quartered.

      <rdfs:comment>
         An agent is something which can show independent action, whether conscious or not.  Agent represents the collection of all agents.  Most animals are considered agents, in most contexts; so are most organizations.   Most plants are not agents, in most contexts.  Inanimate devices are sometimes considered agents, in certain contexts.  This is one of those concepts which is important yet very hard to define precisely.  Here is some elaboration, to help convey the intended meaning of the basic criterion for agenthood:  It must seem that a kind of decision-making is going on, even if it's down at the `mindless' level of the reflex reaction of a spider leg to heat, or the reflex reaction of a Human Resources Department rejecting an applicant with no formal degree.  It generally `sounds right' or `feels  natural' to assign causality to agents, rather than some larger or smaller entity.  E.g., it is more natural to say `Fred wrote an essay' than to say `Fred's left hand wrote an essay' or, at the other extreme, to say `The Solar System wrote an essay'.  Similarly, we might very well talk about `Microsoft' buying IBM, but it would be unnatural and even incorrect to talk about a much larger entity (`corporate America') or smaller entity (`the Microsoft lawyers') as the performer of that buying action.

         A collection of objects.  Every element of Shoe is a shoe or shoelike thing worn on the feet.  Important subsets include Boot-Footwear, Sandal, Slipper, and Casual-Shoe.  Elements of the collection Shoe are single shoes.  Pairs of shoes are elements of the collection denoted by (Pair-Fn Shoe).

         An Attribute-Type whose elements represent the qualitative levels of pain that may be felt by a perceptual agent.  Although the agent is often a living entity, this is not required.  The source of the pain could be either external or internal; in either case, the subjective feeling is generally `sharper' and hopefully shorter-lived than just `a feeling of discomfort' (see: Level-Of-Discomfort.)

         The collection of all partially ordered sets (also called ordered sets, partial orders, or posets), each being a Set-With-Structure consisting of a set together with an ordering relation on that set.   Mathematical directed chains, trees, forests, and lattices are special cases of Partially-Ordered-Set.  The ordering relation is defined on the associated set, and is transitive on that set, reflexive on that set, and antisymmetric on that set.   Sometimes the members of the Partially-Ordered-Set are called its nodes, and the non-redundant (transitively reduced) pairwise relations between the nodes are called the links.  A Partially-Ordered-Set may be finite or infinite, and connected or unconnected.  (Note: A Partially-Ordered-Set is not a Set-Or-Collection, rather it is a Set-With-Structure that has an associated Set-Or-Collection.)

An instance of Eating-Event is a meal or snack taken in its entirety; it is a series of individual Eating-A-Morsel events.
Note:  If a group of people gets together and eats lunch, that activity is represented by an instance of Having-A-Meal; during that `super-event' each participant engages in his/her own instance of Eating-Event, and all of those are Sub-Events of the Having-A-Meal event.

Note:  It is often the case that a Transformation-Event is NOT a Transformation-Process --- e.g., there may be several preparation stages, and then at the end everything is brought together and the foaming starts, or the butterfly emerges, or whatever transformation occurs.  So Transformation-Process is a small subset of Transformation-Event (qv).

A Tree-Ordered-Set is a special case of Partially-Ordered-Set in which no element has multiple 'parent' nodes.  There are no cycles of relations in a Tree-Ordered-Set: from every element, there is exactly one path to the root-element.  Many, but not all, taxonomic hierarchies are Tree-Ordered-Sets.  The end or 'bottom' nodes are sometime called 'leaf nodes'.  A Totally-Ordered-Set or directed chain is a special case of a Tree-Ordered-Set that happens to have no branchings.  (Note that Tree-Ordered-Set requires a single root node and therefore excludes mathematical 'forests' consisting of multiple, disconnected Tree-Ordered-Sets.)

         A collection of intangible objects.  Each element of Propositional-Information-Thing is a chunk of abstract propositional information (`a PIT' abbreviates `a propositional information thing').  Such a chunk of information may consist of one or more propositions.  The propositional content of a PIT is not intrinsically encoded in any particular language, but it may be representable in many languages.  PITs are used to represent the meaningful contents of information bearing things.  Physical things--objects or events--which are elements of Information-Bearing-Thing are linked to the abstract PIT contents they embody, by using the predicate Contains-Information (q.v.).  An element of Propositional-Information-Thing may be something as simple as the information content of a command to stop one's vehicle, expressed verbally or symbolically in a road sign or in a traffic officer's gesture; or a PIT may be something as complex as the entire contemporary knowledge of Mathematics, which is embodied in many and various sources.  More examples: the story embodied in a showing of the movie `Citizen Kane', the information in my resume, the content of a conversation in American Sign Language, and the information contained in the Cyc-KB, may all be represented as PITs.
Note that the collection Propositional-Information-Thing is a subset of Microtheory, which makes the Cyc inference mechanisms for handling microtheories available to manage the propositional content of information bearing things.  See also Microtheory and Ist-Information.

         A collection of collections.  Each instance of Default-Disjoint-Food-Type is a collection of beverages or foodstuffs (a subset of Food or Food-Ingredient-Only).  More to the point, this collection-of-collections is a Sibling-Disjoint-Collection (qv).  So every two instances of Default-Disjoint-Food-Type are either disjoint, or are in a known subset/superset relationship, or have some known (reified) common specialization.  Virtually every commonly-named type of food will be an element of this set-of-sets.  E.g., the collections Hot-Dog, Chicken-Soup, Cocoa-The-Powder, Prune, Toaster-Tart, Milk-Powder, and so on.  One could easily define a collection of foodstuff and beverages, such as The-Food-That-Was-Eaten-In-Dallas-Yesterday, that would not be a member of this set-of-sets, but most such collections are not worth naming and keeping around.  See the concept Sibling-Disjoint-Collection for more information about this sort of arrangement.

         A collection of artifacts.  Each element of Path-Artifact is a path made by agents, whether animal or human.  Elements of Path-Artifact range from deer trails to superhighways.  Such paths connect places that animals or people are found in and/or between which they want to travel.  Examples: Erie-Canal, Welland-Ship-Canal, Champs-Elysee, Wall-Street, US-Highway80, Highway101CA.

         A collection of construction artifacts.  Each element of Human-Residence is a humanly constructed shelter (or a part of one) in which humans reside--as opposed to, say, their places of employment (though the two might be the same).  Human-Residence includes residential huts, igloos, longhouses, hotels, barracks, palaces, houseboats, mobile homes, as well as apartments, duplexes, and detached houses.  A person's residence is typically the place where she/he usually sleeps and keeps most personal effects.

         A collection of events; a subset of Composite-Physical-And-Mental-Event.  Each element of Social-Occurrence is an event in which two or more agents (and often many more than two) take part.  Often, elements of Social-Occurrence involve communication among the participating agents.   Usually there are some social occurrences in every culture that have very elaborate role structures (e.g., a lawsuit or a wedding), and some that are fairly simple (e.g., belching at the dinner table).

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of objects.  An 
instance of Portable-Object is something that is not 
`fastened down' and which is light enough for an average human 
(or more to the point: for its average intended user) to move 
it easily.  For many Portable-Objects, portability is 
important for them to fulfill their primary functions; 
for example, an article of clothing (a Something-To-Wear), 
a hand-guided tool (a #HandTool), a coin or dollar bill (an instance of Currency), a flashlight (a Flashlight), etc. would be pretty useless if they weren't portable.  In other cases, making a device portable, or making a portable version of a device, simply provides a convenience, as with the subsets Portable-Television and Portable-Stereo-System.  Note that Tool is not a subset of Portable-Object, since many tools are heavy and/or stationary.  A borderline example would be a heart/lung machine; although the beneficiary of its primary function is in no position to move it around, the physicians and nurses who also are `using' it can and do exactly that.  The same goes for a playpen; the kids in it had better NOT be able to move it around, but the adults who set it up and put them there can and do move it.   A borderline non-example would be a car; even though its user can make it move around, that is more a controlling action than a transporting action --- i.e., the car is doing the transporting in that case, not the driver.  A borderline example is a cat; even though it moves under its own power, it is light enough for its owner to pick it up and move around.  A borderline example is a bed or a dresser; though too heavy to lift, its owners can generally move it around (by sliding, disassembling and reassembling, etc.)

         This refers to those overhanging levels or balconies found in some churches, theatres, etc.  They ARE NOT the kind of balcony that protrude from a window or from an already existing level.  These levels are often a third the size of the floor or level below them, and therefore can be called legitimate levels themselves.  They usually contain a mob of seats.

         A collection of rotational movements; a subset of Movement-Rotation.  In any instance of Rotation-Periodic, either partial rotation (e.g., rocking) or full rotation (e.g., spinning) occurs periodically.  Examples include the swinging of a clock pendulum and the rotation of the Earth on its axis.  Note that the accuracy and duration of the periodic rotation is context-dependent.  E.g., in a context spanning a long enough period of time, and/or if measured sufficiently accurately, the Earth's rotation does not have a fixed period.  In a context short enough, and `approximate' enough, a spinning Olympic ice skater is performing a Rotation-Periodic event, even though a few seconds later they slow down and stop rotating.

Note: it is NOT any particular physical, tangible representation; different encodings may represent the characters.  An element of Character-String has characters from some fixed character set.  The characters are instances of Character-Abstract. An element of Character-String may be any length, including zero (i.e., empty strings, which have no characters).  If elements of Character-String are concatenated, the result is also an element of Character-String.  The length of the resulting string is equal to the sum of the lengths of the concatenated strings.   Some types (subsets) of Character-String include E-Mail-Address, Area-Code, Phone-Number, Phone-Country-Code, etc.

Note that elements of Mental-Information are the propositional content of memories, perceptions, judgments, etc.  For example, when I remember that my grandmother's eyes are blue, the mental information contained therein is `my [the rememberer's] grandmother's eyes are blue'; it is NOT `I remember that my grandmother's eyes are blue'.  As a consequence, mental information (as defined in Cyc) is not incorrigible.

         A collection of collections.  Each element of Existing-Stuff-Type is a collection of things (including portions of things) which are temporally and spatially stufflike; they may also be stufflike in other ways, e.g., in some physical property.  Division in time or space does not destroy the stufflike quality of the object.  For example, every piece of wood is temporally stufflike: if W-168 is a piece of wood during 1996, then it's also a piece of wood for the one-minute time-slice 9:05am 7/7/96.  It's also spatially stufflike: if we take that piece of wood W-168 and cut it in half, we have two things which are both pieces of wood.  The fact that every piece of wood is both temporally and spatially stufflike is represented in Cyc by the assertion (:Direct-Types Wood Existing-Stuff-Type).  Other examples of Existing-Stuff-Type: Apple-Juice, Ice-Cream, Diamond, Waxed-Paper, Striated-Muscle. See the comment for Stuff-Type to learn more about the distinctions between, and the need for, these four collections: Stuff-Type, Object-Type, Existing-Stuff-Type, and Existing-Object-Type.

         A collection of events.  An
Organizational-Transfer occurs when some Intelligent-Agent changes
affiliation with some Organization.  This can involve becoming a
member of the organization, ceasing to be a member of it, or switching
from one organization to another.  An Organizational-Transfer may be
voluntarily undertaken by the transferee but may also be Performed-By
some other agent.  Examples include: joining a club, being transferred
from one division of a company to another, and being excommunicated.
Negative examples include: transfer of objects or information between
organizations (since these aren't Intelligent-Agents), and changes of
Nationality (since neither Nationality nor Country is currently
a kind of Organization).

         The collection Vector-Interval is a subset of N-Tuple-Interval.  Each element of Vector-Interval is an n-tuple of intervals (where n &gt; 1), one of which is a direction.  Like the elements of Scalar-Interval, the intervals in an element of Vector-Interval may be point-valued or cover a range of values.  The minimal interval (i.e., point-valued) type of vector interval is exemplified by a vector such as `10 meters due east'.   Vectors may also cover a range of values; e.g., `at least 10 feet away and in a horizontal direction'; `between ten to twelve miles NNW'.

         A collection of events.  In each Teeth-Cleaning event, an animal's teeth are cleaned.  In order to distinguish, e.g., professional teeth cleaning by a dental technician from daily personal care, different microtheories are used.  Consider just the frequencies of performing this action: in the Human-Activities-Mt, where a person brushes their own teeth as a subevent of Daily-Personal-Cleaning, this occurs once or twice per day.  In the Provider-Of-Service-Perspective-Mt, that is from the dental hygienist's point of view, it occurs about ten times per day.  In the Recipient-Of-Service-Perspective-Mt, that is from the point of view of someone going to get their teeth cleaned at a dentist's office, it happens a couple times per year.

         A collection of events; a subset of Drug-Therapy (q.v.).  In an instance of Anesthesia, a Biological-Living-Object undergoes the effect of some instance of Anesthetic, the effect of which is to eliminate the perception of pain.  Anesthesia events occur in connection with other medical care events, so that a patient will not feel the pain or discomfort that would otherwise be associated with those medical procedures.  Anesthetics are of various chemical kinds, work in various ways, and can be administered in various ways.  They may topically numb an area, they may poison the central nervous system to the point where the animal loses consciousness, etc.  The resulting anesthetic therapies thus may differ, according to the type of anesthetic used; for example, the patient may or may not be conscious during an instance of Anesthesia.

         A collection of attributes; a subset of Physical-Attribute.  Each element of Elasticity represents a specific ability of a physical material to quickly and completely return to its original shape after deformation that does not induce breakage, without permanent change to its original dimensions.  For example, billiard balls have a high degree of elasticity in this sense.  Elasticities of objects are indicated with the predicate Elasticity-Of-Object.

         A collection of durable artifacts which are used in Human-Shelter-Constructions to make human dwelling places more comfortable.  An instance of Furniture-Piece is a whole piece of furniture, such as a table, chair, or chest of drawers; an arm of a sofa is not a Furniture-Piece.  Its subsets can be classified according to the main functions their elements serve:  (1) providing support for people's bodies while they are seated or reclining (e.g., Bed-Piece-Of-Furniture, Sofa-Piece-Of-Furniture, Foot-Stool, Fixed-Theatre-Seat); (2) providing work/action surfaces (e.g., Desk-Piece-Of-Furniture, Dining-Room-Table); (3) providing organized and/or protective storage for people's stuff (e.g., Dresser-Piece-Of-Furniture, Bookcase-Piece-Of-Furniture); (4) providing extra illumination or some other function in living and work areas (e.g., Electric-Lamp).  Most pieces of furniture belong to the collection Non-Powered-Device (q.v.) in that they don't need any energy input in order to do their function.  
Note: Yes, of course lamps, fancy console TVs, hospital beds, etc. are exceptions to that last rule -- they require power. But in a sense they are really objects performing multiple independent functions.  A fancy console TV is a piece of furniture even when it's turned off; it just so happens to fulfill two roles, one as a piece of furniture and one as an appliance.  When it's turned on, in fact, its users are intended to stop noticing it as a piece of furniture.)

         This is a collection of collections.  Each Social-Attribute-Type is itself a coherent collection of attributes that pertain to human behavior.  This definition is very broad, and embraces attributes of behavior (personal and social) one might read about in a sociology, psychology, cultural anthropology, economics, political science, or social philosophy course -- in short, in the (human) `behavioral' sciences.  A more specialized concept is Social-Status-Attribute-Type, which limits the focus to status-related attributes.  This is a superset of that, much more general collection which includes, as elements, Acquaintance-Attribute, Inter-Agent-Relation-Attribute, etc., as well as all the elements of Social-Status-Attribute-Type (qv).

      <rdfs:comment>
         Instances of Rule-Macro-Predicate are predicates that have, implicit in their definition, the schema for a class of quantified formulas.  A ground assertion (GAF) using one of these predicates is in fact shorthand for a rule fitting this schema.  For example, :Direct-Superclasses is a Rule-Macro-Predicate and its implicit schema would be (:=&gt; (:Direct-Types ?X ARG1) (:Direct-Types ?X ARG2)).  Therefore, (:Direct-Superclasses Poodle Dog) is shorthand for the rule (:=&gt; (:Direct-Types ?X Poodle) (:Direct-Types ?X Dog)).  Rule-Macro-Predicates may be supported by system code, as is :Direct-Superclasses, or they may be defined with an Expansion-Axiom.  In general, one should only introduce a new RuleMacroPredicate if 1) there is a plan to eventually provide code support for efficient reasoning with its uses, and/or 2) using it enables useful type-level reasoning.

For example, the collection specified by `the book War and Peace' is an element of Specified-Information-Bearing-Thing-Type; so is the collection described by `the movie Jaws' (even though both the novel `War and Peace' and the film `Jaws' were issued in slightly different variants).  Heterogeneous collections, however, such as those defined by `books written by Mark Twain', or by `the Jaws story in all its forms [movie, book, comic book, tape]', are NOT elements of Specified-Information-Bearing-Thing-Type, although they are subsets of Information-Bearing-Thing.  Examples of Specified-Information-Bearing-Thing-Type: Adventures-Of-Huckleberry-Finn-The-Book, OS-2, Lotus123, Peloponnesian-War-History-By-Thucydides-The-Book, Citizen-Kane-The-Movie.

         The collection of all animals' reproductive systems.  A Reproductive-System is a system of organs used by the Animal for reproduction; i.e., for creating an offspring, a new member of that species.  
Note:  Strictly speaking, it might be more accurate to describe a Reproductive-System as containing the above sorts of systems for a mated male and female of a sexual species, as only that combined system is capable of actually producing an offspring.  But most of the things one wants to say about a Reproductive-System really do only make sense for one single animal at a time.  So think of reproduction as a cooperative activity, such as having a conversation, where we still refer to each animal's incomplete reproductive system as a Reproductive-System.

         Time-Interval is a subset of Temporal-Thing.  Each Time-Interval can be characterized fully just by specifying its temporal attributes.  Anything which has a temporal extent is an instance of Temporal-Thing, but if that is essentially ALL that it has, then it is also a Time-Interval.  For example, `the year 1967' is a just a Time-Interval: although many interesting things happened during that year, the year itself is completely defined by its temporal extent.  `Neil Armstrong Walking on the Moon' is an Event, not a Time-Interval, since it would be defined by many non-temporal assertions. And of course, `Neil Armstrong' is a Something-Existing, not a Time-Interval, but like all instances of Something-Existing, he does have temporal extent and is therefore a Temporal-Thing.  One could, in principle, separately reify (name) the Time-Interval which is the period of existence of any Something-Existing, or the period of time during which any Event occurred, but in practice that is rarely useful.  Since they all have an implicit Time-Interval associated with them, any predicates which one might apply to time intervals can also be applied to a football game, a football, etc.  E.g., we can talk about the Starting-Point of a football game, or for that matter the Starting-Point of the football itself (the moment of its creation).

         The collection of actions in which a device goes from one state (the From-State) to another state (the To-State).  A change of Device-State may be due to an outside Agent adjusting a device, or it may happen automatically due to the behavior of a device.  The two most general state changes (for powered devices) are from Device-On to Device-Off, and vice versa.  Many other states peculiar to specific devices can be identified; for example, the states of a Dishwasher: Device-State-Washing and Device-State-Rinsing; or the states that a trapping device may be in: Trap-Armed, Trap-Tripped, Trap-Idle.  Note that a change in the state of a device is an intrinsic change in the device; i.e., Changing-Device-State is a subset of Intrinsic-State-Change-Event.

         A collection of events.  For most animals, a Digestion-Event starts at the mouth and, for most vertebrates, end at the anus.  This concept should not be confused with Digesting-In-Stomach, whose instances occur only in an organism's Stomach.  A Digestion-Event spans the whole Digestive-System, from start to finish.

When they coincide, the commonsense class of organism (e.g., Person) is an instance of some Biological-Taxon-Type (Biological-Species, for example).  See also Organism-Classification-Type.

The elements of Vegetable-Plant grow in gardens and produce the vegetables that are eaten; vegetable plants are not necessarily also elements of Food.  See Vegetable-Food for the collection of vegetables--plants or (more usually) plant parts--that are eaten by humans.

         A collection of events.  In an instance of Causing-Another-Objects-Translational-Motion, one object causes another object to undergo a translational motion.  The object causing the motion is the Provider-Of-Motive-Force.  The object which is caused to move is the Object-Acted-On (and also the Object-Moving) in the event.  One way to cause another object's motion is by carrying it along with one (see the subset Carrying-While-Locomoting), but there are many others, such as throwing, kicking, or knocking it away.  Examples: a train transporting passengers; a person pushing a coin into a vending machine; the release of a bowstring which propels an arrow; a magnet attracting a nail.

         A collection of Things that are paths or can be considered paths.  Each Path-Generic is either a Path-Simple or a Path-Cyclic, i.e., either a non-self-crossing path or a cycle.  A Path-Generic may be abstract (as in Graph Theory), or it may be concrete such as a Path-Customary, for example a road, railroad, sea-lane, cowpath, pipe, blood vessel, fiber or wire, or on the other hand it could be anything that is used as a path in some Path-System.  If a Path-Generic is a Path-Customary, then it may or may not have a specified Path-System in which it is a path; if the Path-Generic is not a Path-Customary, then it can only be a path in some given Path-System.  For example, an orange is not a customary path, but it can be a path for ants in a specified ant path system.  For any Path-Generic, there can be a Traversal of something moving along that path; a single Traversal can cross itself, double back along itself, and/or go back and forth along some part of a Path-Generic any number of times.

of this collection, as would straining to hear something, but

         A collection of mathematical objects; a subset of Tuple.  Each element of N-Tuple-Interval is a tuple (an ordered list of items) whose items are intervals.  For example, vectors and complex numbers, as well as scalar intervals (which are one-tuples).  Note that intervals in Cyc may be numerical, or they may be intervals along any scale with distinguishable gradations (e.g., riskiness, alertness, roughness of texture).

         #$IntrinsicStateChangeEvent
      </Name-In-Cyc>
      <rdfs:comment>
         The collection of Events which are characterized primarily by a change in some intrinsic property of one main entity involved in the event (i.e., one of the Actors).  Such intrinsic changes may include changes of a thing's color, temperature, device state, size, and so on.  Events where the main change is extrinsic (such as a change in location or ownership) are not Intrinsic-State-Change-Events.  In events which have more than one actor, the event may be an Intrinsic-State-Change-Event for one actor but not for another.  For example, in a Fastening-Safety-Belt event, the Safety-Seat-Belt (the device used) goes from unconnected to connected (to itself), which is an intrinsic change; however, the agent who does the fastening (i.e., who is Handling-A-Device) does not change intrinsically, but only in its configuration to the belt, an external object.  Another example: in a Hair-Cutting-Event, the hair that is barbered undergoes an Intrinsic-State-Change-Event due to its role in that kind of event, but the barber undergoes no intrinsic change due to the hair cutting.

Note: Some events, such as an ice cube melting into a small puddle of water, could be represented in Cyc either as an Intrinsic-State-Change-Event or as a Transformation-Event but not (within a single micro-theory) as both; see the comments on those constants.

Each instance of Government-COC is a formal regulation of behavior imposed upon agents -- including citizens, tourists, businesses, government entities, etc., in so far as they are subject to it -- who are located within the legal jurisdiction where that code of conduct holds.  Government-COC includes both individual laws and whole legal codes.  Some examples of Government-COC include: the Napoleonic Code, the United States Constitution and all Federal, State, and local laws of the United States, and the particular laws against stealing found in most, if not all, countries.  Enforcement of a particular instance of Government-COC is authorized by the government associated with that code and carried out by its agents within their jurisdiction(s).

         A collection of tangible stuffs.  Every instance of Mixture is a tangible stuff composed of two or more different Constituents which have been mixed.  The stuffs which were inputs to the mixing do not form chemical bonds between them, and at a later time the mixture may be resolved by some Separation-Event.  Examples include all elements of the collections Blood, Mud, Air, and Carbonated-Beverage.  A mixture has a composition but not a structure; thus, the following are NOT mixtures, since all have some structure: a wet sponge, a person, or a portion of plywood.
Note: By default, mixtures are assumed to be stable, i.e., they won't separate on their own.  Use Separating-Constituent to override this default for a constituent that does separate out spontaneously (e.g. a Carbonated-Beverage going flat).

      <rdfs:comment>
         Transaction is the collection of events performed by Agents cooperating (willingly) under some Agreement, each performing actions in exchange for the actions of the other. 
Note:  Attack/counterattack in warfare is not a Transaction.  Neither is fortuitous cooperation without agreement, such as a set of investors who, unknown to each other, all buy the same stock almost at once, and end up driving its price up.  On the other hand, if you see agents acting to mutual benefit, it's not a bad strategy to guess that there is some agreement between them.
Note: The word 'transaction' often means an exchange of user rights (to goods and/or money) between agents; see Exchange-Of-User-Rights for that concept.  Transaction is a more general concept, and is a superset of Exchange-Of-User-Rights.

         A collection of information transfer events; a subset of Audio-Communicating.  Each element of Spoken-Communicating is a transmission of sound-borne verbal information by spoken words between two (or more) agents.  The communication may be one-way or two-way (or multi-way); see Communicating.  Examples of Spoken-Communicating: a telephone conversation, a classroom discussion, the Gettysburg-Address-Speech.  Note that the collection Speaking contains events in which a person generates spoken language but doesn't necessarily communicate it; e.g., a person practicing a speech alone.  If someone who is speaking is also communicating, then her speaking is a Sub-Events of some element of Spoken-Communicating.  Every element of Spoken-Communicating has at least one Communication-Token which is an element of Utterance.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of translational motion events; hence a subset of Movement-Translation-Event.  In any instance of Translation-No-Location-Change, the Object-Moving undergoes translational motion but ends up where it started --- i.e., there is no NET movement; i.e., its From-Location and To-Location are the same.  Between the beginning and the end of a Translation-No-Location-Change, the Object-Moving may visit the To-Location and the From-Location any number of times.   E.g., consider the motion of a person who is born in, and 80 years later dies in, the very same hospital, and has been there a few times in between for operations, visiting patients, etc.  A less dramatic example is the motion of your car on a particular day, as it gets moved around, crosses its own path a few times, etc., but ends the day in the same place it started.   Elements of Translation-No-Location-Change may be periodic or nonperiodic movements.  An important subset of Translation-No-Location-Change is Translation-Round-Trip.

         A collection of events.  In an instance of Gaining-User-Rights, some Agent gains possession of something.  Thus, in such an event, that agent newly acquires a right (viz., some User-Rights-Attribute) to use some item.  The item in question is identified as the Object-Of-Possession-Transfer, and the agent is the To-Possessor (i.e., the one to whom the possession comes).  The Agent may or may not be a Deliberate-Actors in the event; e.g., buying a car is done on purpose, but receiving a car as a gift isn't.  If either of those two events happen to you, though, it is an element of the collection Gaining-User-Rights.

      <rdfs:comment>
         The collection of all legal agents; a subset of Agent.  A legal agent is one that has some legal status in a particular legal system.  At the very least, such an agent is recognized by some legal authority as having some kinds of rights and/or responsibilities as an agent (e.g., Citizens of Germany), or as being subject to certain restrictions and penalties (e.g., a company that has been blacklisted by Iraq).  Thus, instances of Legal-Agent include agents that may have property rights, may be taxed, may have a government identification number, may be sued, may have an address, etc. 
Note: membership in this collection is very much dependent upon context.  In some societies, only adult males and various kinds of state-run organizations would be included in Legal-Agents.

In the traditional view, plant organs are of four types: leaves, stems, roots and flowers.  It seems useful to have a category for smaller plant parts which display a similar level of organization (they have vascular tissue, ground tissue, and an epidermis) but have not been included in the traditional view.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of pieces of information; a subset of Propositional-Information-Thing.  Each element of Illocutionary-Force is a specialized component of a communication; its function is to indicate how the speaker in a communication wants the agent(s) whom s/he is addressing to understand, and respond to, the situation--i.e., the state of affairs--described in that communication.  Isolating the `illocutionary force' of a communication allows us to characterize the intention of a speaker; e.g., whether s/he means to assert that the described state of affairs in fact holds; or to express a desire that such a state of affairs hold; or to command someone to make that state of affairs hold; or to offer to make the state of affairs hold.  S/he may even intend to make something true by stating it (e.g., ``I name this ship `The Intrepid'.''). 
Usually, apprehending a speaker's intention is important for understanding what s/he means and what s/he intends the hearer to do.  Although illocutionary forces can be represented propositionally, they are not generally communicated so explicitly.  For example, questions in English are typically communicated by inverting subject-object word order and raising one's intonation at the end of the utterance.  (The intonation marker so strongly indicates a question that it may suffice without the inverted word order, as in `You are going tonight' uttered with a rising intonation.)  Commands in English typically have an (unexpressed) understood subject and perhaps a forceful tone.  In every culture and language there are conventional sets of commonly used illocutionary forces which would be the subsets of Illocutionary-Force for that culture; e.g., in English, they include Inform contexts, Request, Offer, Promise, and Query.
Note: although in this comment Illocutionary-Force is explained in terms of utterances, it applies to communication generally; so `speaker' and `listener' should be broadly interpreted to mean, respectively, any Sender-Of-Info and Recipient-Of-Info.  See also Communicating, Communication-Act-Single.  The portion of a communication's information content that represents the illocutionary force is indicated using Component-IF.

         A collection of collections.  Instances are collections of Tangible-Thing whose membership is based only on the physical and/or chemical composition of the elements, and not on any other property.  Thus Tangible-Stuff-Composition-Type does not have as elements any collections whose instances are determined by the physical state they are in.  For example, the collection Water is an instance of Tangible-Stuff-Composition-Type: instances of Water are all pieces of substance with the chemical composition H20.   On the other hand , the collection of all pieces of ice [i.e., (Solid-Fn Water)] is not a Tangible-Stuff-Composition-Type, because membership in the collection of ice depends not solely on the substance's composition, but also on its physical state.  More sample instances of Tangible-Stuff-Composition-Type:  the collections Nylon, Gasoline-Fuel, Cottage-Cheese, Fatty-Tissue, Baby-Powder, Nitrogen, and Glass.

         A collection of dynamic, physiological states.  An instance of Allergic-Reaction is an event in which an organism which is exposed to a particular substance (e.g., pollen, mold) develops some abnormality or impairment of its physiological condition as a result of interacting with the substance.  Allergic reactions to some types of substances occur widely in members of a species; e.g., Poison-Ivy-Poisoning in humans.  But other allergic reactions affect only a small proportion of a species, such as human allergies to penicillin.  This concept is the set of events in which allergic reactions are `taking place', not abstract unrealized potential situations such as `John is allergic to milk.'  I.e., if John were allergic to milk, and he drank some, and then proceeded to have a whopping bad allergic reaction, that latter event would be an element of Allergic-Reaction.

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of translational motion events; hence a subset of Movement-Translation-Event. In any element of Translation-Flow, the Object-Moving is a Fluid-Tangible-Thing (i.e., a portion of some fluid, such as a quart of milk) rather than a discrete solid object.  At least some of the Object-Moving leaves the From-Location and some arrives at the To-Location; but it is not necessary that all of the Object-Moving go from the origin (From-Location) to the destination (To-Location).  Such fluid flows include rivers flowing or winds blowing or air filling your lungs when you take a breath.
Note: also intended to be included here are flows of ``fluids'' such as sand, drifting snow, etc., which are composed of multiple solid particles.  So a borderline case would be using a bulldozer to spread out a pile of rocks and gravel over a parking lock; depending on one's context (sensors, purposes, etc.) that might or might not be considered a Translation-Flow event.

         A collection of information bearing things (IBTs).  Each element of Map-Cartographic is an IBT which, properly interpreted, models a region of physical space many times its own size by using graphical symbols (or possibly another code), often in conjunction with a natural language, to represent features of one or more of the following kinds: geographical areas (Geographical-Region), topographical features (Topographical-Feature), political regions (Geopolitical-Entity), climate zones (Climate-Cycle-Type), human artifacts (Construction-Artifact), population densities (Population-Density), etc.  Maps are generally intended to help an agent to orient itself in space or to understand some aspect(s) of a large spatial area.  The collection Map-Cartographic includes terrestrial and celestial maps, either on paper, in computerized geographical information systems, or in other forms.

         A collection of tangible things.  Each element of Semi-Solid-Tangible-Thing is a tangible thing that is intrinsically in a semisolid state.  Some semisolids are pourable (e.g., sand) and some are not (e.g., jello).  When a force is first applied to a semisolid, the object moves or deforms substantially and does not break or crack.  Semisolids are stirrable (thus, rubber is probably not a semisolid).  A semisolid can be deformed into any shape that does not require some dimension of the object to be smaller than all dimensions of the granule size of that stuff; e.g., a Mob of hailstones cannot form a paper-thin sheet.  The granules of a Pourable semisolid, such as sand, may themselves belong to Solid-Tangible-Thing.

         A collection of objects.  Each element of Symbolic-Object by convention symbolizes some thing or event or achievement, without describing it propositionally in any detail.  Examples include national flags, military medals and ribbons, school colors, an Oscar, a Crucifix, a caduceus, trademark logos of commercial brands.  Elements of Symbolic-Object need not have propositional information contents; probably most do not.  Rather, symbolic objects are typically associated (by an informed interpreter) with the particular entities that originated or appropriated them.  To emotional interpreters, such as humans, symbolic objects are often evocative of certain attitudes associated with the entities symbolized--such as nationalism, respect, school spirit, hatred, reverence, etc.  Only some elements of Symbolic-Object have the Primary-Function of serving as symbols (e.g., national flags, war memorials); others are symbolic in a secondary capacity (e.g., a gravestone symbolizes death but its primary function is as a marker).  Some objects are created to serve a symbolic function (primary or secondary), while others acquire symbolic associations in the course of their `lifetimes' (e.g., San Juan Hill, Ellis Island).  Examples of Symbolic-Object: the Arc-De-Triomphe, the Statue-Of-Liberty, the Pyramid-Of-Cheops, the United-States-Capitol-Building (and other capitol buildings); a hangman's noose, a Menorah, a white dove, a black armband.

         Physical-State-Change-Event is the collection of events in which some piece of matter changes from one of the physical states of matter to another.  Such changes of state can be induced by changes in temperature (or the equivalent in the manipulation of kinetic energy).  Each particular instance of Boiling, Freezing, Evaporating, Condensing, Melting, etc. is an instance of Physical-State-Change-Event.  

Note: Most Cyc microtheories distinguish four states of matter, namely, Solid-State-Of-Matter, Semi-Solid-State-Of-Matter, Liquid-State-Of-Matter, Gaseous-State-Of-Matter.  See State-Of-Matter-Solid-Liquid-Gaseous and its individual state constants.

      <rdfs:comment>
         This collection is a subset of Movement-Event.  An element of this set is an Event in which the center of mass of the Object-Moving changes location, with respect to the relevant frame of reference.  Moreover, the moving object travels along some Pathway-Complete from its origin (From-Location) to its stopping place (To-Location) and must, at some point during the movement, be in a different location than it was at the start of motion (even if it ultimately returns to the origin).  So:  One special subset of translational movements includes those in which the movement ends in the same place it started from (e.g., one lap of a race car around the Indianapolis race trace; a trip to the grocery store and back); this subset is Translation-No-Location-Change (including its subset Translation-Round-Trip).  The other case is where the From-Location and To-Location of a Movement-Translation-Event are different; in that case, the movement event is also an element of Translation-Location-Change (e.g., the movement of the baseball during a home run hit by Roger Maris.)     Note that a Stationary object cannot be an Object-Moving in a Movement-Translation-Event, because it has a zero translational velocity.

         A collection of concrete physical objects.  Each instance of Conveyance is intended for moving (at least partially tangible) things --- it could be a car, ship, plane, or other vehicle for transporting people; it could be a conveyor belt, a grocery bag, etc.  See also Transportation-Device which is used to axiomatize more specific kinds of conveying events in which the object doing the conveying actually moves along with the object being transported.  See Transportation-Event for the collection of events about this more specific kind of conveying event.  Some positive exemplars:  a gun, a car, a slingshot.  A borderline non-exemplar is a wire over which electricity, signals, etc. are moving.

         The collection of public and private entertainment performances, like plays, street performances, ballets, movies.  Each Entertainment-Performance  is a presentation or exhibition, to a human audience, with artistic or entertainment value.  
Note:  Movies are included even though the Performers aren't performing in the same point in space-time.  But we draw the line at still photographs; i.e., those are not considered Entertainment-Performances.

         The collection of things which are made of some sort of matter and whose nature is primarily material--in the sense that they do not have important non-physical properties (such as encoded information).  (Compare Partially-Tangible.)  Tangible-Thing includes chemical compounds, natural objects (and their parts), tangible artifacts and man-made materials (but see Information-Bearing-Object).  Collections that are specializations of Tangible-Thing may be elements of Existing-Object-Type or Existing-Stuff-Type (qq.v.), or of neither.  
Note: Tangible-Thing has the genls Partially-Tangible in the Base-KB, so its elements are NOT generally excluded from having intangible aspects; however, material things which do have important non-physical aspects should be elements of Partially-Tangible instead.  Moreover, note that in some contexts, all instances of this collection must be 100% tangible and have no intangible aspects (i.e., it is Disjoint-With Partially-Tangible).

Note: Secretions are different from Excretion-Substance in that secretions are not necessarily waste products.  E.g., they may be a release of pheromones to attract a mate, a layer of sweat to cool off the organism, a layer of nectar to attract bees, etc.  Some subsets of Secretion-Bodily, such as Sweat, are also subsets of Excretion-Substance (i.e., wastes).

      <rdfs:comment>
         A collection of predicates; the subset of :Slot whose elements represent antisymmetric relations.  A predicate F is an element of Anti-Symmetric-Binary-Predicate if and only if F is a binary predicate and, if both (F X Y) and (F Y X) hold, then X=Y, for every X,Y within the domain and range of F.  For example, Greater-Than-Or-Equal-To, Compatible-Blood-Types.







Note this additional restriction: A Cyc predicate F can be an element of Anti-Symmetric-Binary-Predicate only if the type (i.e., arg-Isa) constraint applicable to F's first argument is not disjoint with the type constraint applicable to F's second argument.  See also Note-On-Argument-Typing-And-Properties-Of-Relations.

      </Name-In-Cyc>
      <rdfs:comment>
         Order-Of-Magnitude-Interval, a subset of Scalar-Interval, is the collection of intervals which represent significant differences in quantity, for the various types of measurable properties.  The most familiar case is for numbers, in which orders of magnitudes typically correspond with powers of 10; thus, in any given numerical quantity, the 100's dominate the 10's or the units, which are negligible with respect to the hundreds.  In Cyc, we can identify the significant intervals for any measurable property.  For example, for Time, some intervals which represent orders of magnitude are: A-Few-Seconds-Duration, A-Few-Minutes-Duration, A-Few-Hours-Duration, A-Few-Days-Duration, A-Few-Weeks-Duration, etc.  Similar scales could be identified for any measurable property.  Moreover, orders of magnitude for the same measurable property may differ between microtheories; e.g., the orders of magnitude for Time in a `GeologicalTimeMt' would be much larger than those listed above, which are relevant for human perceptions and activities.  



Any two attributes which represent amounts of the same kind of property (e.g., time, distance) and which are also elements of Order-Of-Magnitude-Interval will be assumed to differ so substantially in size that the smaller one (and values associated with it) will be insignificant compared to the larger interval (and values associated with it).  That is, in general and as a default, if ORD1 and ORD2 are two different elements of Order-Of-Magnitude-Interval which are also elements of the same type of Attribute-Value (e.g., Speed, Mass, Density), then one is negligible with respect to the other.  To know which dominates the other, we need additional knowledge about their relative size, e.g., that ORD2 is a Following-Value of (i.e., 'bigger' than) ORD1.  See also Negligible-WRT, Following-Value.  The predicate Order-Of-Magnitude (q.v.) is used to relate particular quantities to the appropriate element of Order-Of-Magnitude-Interval.  For example, two days -- in Cyc, (Days-Duration 2) -- has the Order-Of-Magnitude A-Few-Days-Duration.

         A set of agents.  Elements of Professional are agents who spend a significant part of their waking hours doing activities that are characteristic of some occupation, skilled or unskilled.  However, elements of Professional need not be working the entire duration of when they are a professional, such as a Professor on summer break, or someone who is temporarily unemployed.  The elements of Professional are persons, most of whom belong to at least one such collection during some portion of their lives.  Typically their actions are performed for pay, but not always (e.g., Artist-Visual).  What are colloquially considered professions or occupations are subsets of Professional; for example, Lumber-Jack, Scientist, Lifeguard, Stock-Broker, Technician, Craft-Worker, Housekeeper, Sports-Coach, Athlete, Legal-Professional, Publicist, Crew-Member-On-Ship, Self-Employed-Worker (and many more).  Additionally, other subsets of Professional classify workers according to other features of their working life besides skills; e.g., Self-Employed-Worker, Desk-Worker.   Subsets may be general (e.g., Desk-Worker, Doctor-Medical) or specialized (e.g., Continuing-Ed-Program-Coordinator, Pediatric-Neuro-Surgeon).  Elements of Professional are people: Mary-Shepherd (Human-Cyclist), Michael-Jordan (Athlete), Alfred-North-Whitehead (Philosopher), Michelangelo (Sculptor, Painter-Fine-Artist), Bill-Clinton (United-States-President), etc.

         Time-Quantity is a physical 
quantity possessed by Temporal-Things.  An Event transpires 
over a certain amount of Time-Quantity, a Something-Existing 
exists for a lifetime which is a certain amount of Time-Quantity,
 and of course an abstract Time-Interval has a duration which 
is a certain amount of Time-Quantity.   The standard unit of 
Time-Quantity in Cyc is Seconds-Duration (qv) but there can 
be and are many other ways to specify an amount of time; e.g., 
with other Unit-Of-Measure instances such as Weeks-Duration 
and Years-Duration, and with reified quantities of (instances 
of) Time-Quantity such as Long-Time, Immediately, 
A-Few-Decades-Duration, etc.

         The collection of things that are not physical -- are not made of, or encoded in, matter.  Every Collection is an Intangible (even if its instances are tangible), and so are some Individuals.  Caution: do not confuse `tangibility' with `perceivability' -- humans can perceive light even though it's intangible--at least in a sense.  For more on this issue, see the relevant Cyclist-Notes.

         A collection of events.  Each element of Wave-Propagation is an event in which a wavelike disturbance propagates through space, with or without a medium.  A wave propagation is like a translational movement in that it can have a From-Location and a To-Location, but differs in that there is no Object-Moving. Sound and Electromagnetic-Radiation are types of Wave-Propagation.  Elements of Wave-Propagation include the sounds from exploding firecrackers at Penn State's Homecoming celebration in 1989; the light shining from my desk lamp right now; the X-rays generated in the dentist's office last Tuesday, for examining my teeth.

         The collection of all portions, regions, or quantities of empty space (whether connected in one piece or unconnected, in multiple pieces).  The meaning of `empty' depends on context. A high energy physics microtheory might define `empty' as containing no particles, thus an element of Pure-Space would be a complete vacuum.  But an element of Pure-Space in Ambient-Conditions-Mt would be a piece of Atmosphere.  An undersea context could treat Pure-Space as seawater.  Elements of Pure-Space are not committed to tangibility, so elements may be intangible or abstract pieces of space.

In Cyc, the constraints for a The-Term in a given context are given by use of the predicate The-Term-Constraints on the unit representing that context.  In lifting assertions out of that context, the constraints are added as antecedents.

         The set of parts of an animal's body that one might point to, operate on, photograph, transplant, etc.  So this is a collection of (conceptual) spatial subdivisions of the bodies of Animals, generally contiguous and having some more or less clear boundary.  Some elements of this collections are Einstein's head, Santas-Beard, and Babe Ruth's right arm.  Other elements of this set are what might be considered unhealthy body regions, such as a blister, a puncture wound, a bruise, etc. -- but those are still clearly a part of an animal's body, can be pointed to, photographed, bandaged up, etc.   
Note that this concept is quite different from an animal body `system' (such as the lymph system, the nervous system, etc.) which comprises a small portion of an animal's total mass but is distributed throughout the animal's body -- see Animal-Body-Part.  (At the naive, commonsense level of physiology, and for almost all purposes, it is perfectly acceptable to conceptualize Santa's beard as one Animal-Body-Region, and the same for Farrah Fawcett's hair, etc.  A borderline case of this is:  Cher's fingernails.  In some contexts, one would treat those as an Animal-Body-Region, and in other contexts one would treat them as ten separate Animal-Body-Regions.)

         A subset of Movement-Translation-Event.  Each element of Translation-Single-Path is a translational movement which involves exactly one Pathway-Complete.  One or more items may have the role of Object-Moving in such an event.  Note that although there is a single Pathway-Complete, it does not follow that there is a unique From-Location and a unique To-Location because that depends on our descriptions of locations.  (A single-pathed movement can be described as from TX to PA, or from Austin to Pittsburgh, or even from Northwest in Austin to Oakland in Pittsburgh.)  However, the single Pathway-Complete connects From-Location and To-Location.  Consider a translational motion performed by a whole group; it is likely to be a Translation-Single-Path ---  e.g., a flock of birds flying together, or a snarl of rush-hour traffic on the Beltway.  Negative examples (see Translation-Multi-Path) would be: a set of billiard balls during the opening break, a group of water droplets that come together into one big drop.

         A Time-Point is a piece of time which has an infinitely small duration.  In Cyc's basic representation of time, all time is like an infinite straight line, and any Time-Point is like a point on that line.  Many temporal attributes of a Temporal-Thing may be described in terms of time points; e.g., its Starting-Point.  A Time-Point can also be contextual, such as Now.

      <rdfs:comment>
         The collection of all surfaces (including Surface-Abstract and Surface-Physical); each is a Spatial-Thing that has extent in at least two dimensions, but either does not have a thickness (i.e. a two dimensional object) or has an insignificant thickness compared with its length and width (Note: if the object is a closed surface, e.g. an apple skin, any significant sub region must have insignificant thickness compared to its length and width).  Surfaces may be two or three dimensional, tangible or intangible.  Such a surface may be curved, folded, crumpled, or flat.  Thus a Euclidian two dimensional disc, a dinner plate, a crumpled sheet of paper, the top of a desk, a ribbon, and a basket ball's skin are exemplars of a Surface-Generic.  They may be spatially connected or not spatially connected.  Thus, both a frisbee and the Milky Way galaxy (as it appears in the sky) are exemples.  Negative exemplars include an entire basket ball (i.e. its skin plus the cavity inside), a planet, and a euclidian solid sphere. All of these are negative exemplars because thickness is not significantly smaller than length and width.  If an object has an Area-Of-Object it must be a Surface-Generic.  If the object `has two sides' (e.g. a sheet of paper, a frisbee, but not Texas-State or an Inside-Surface of a cave or room.  (See One-Sided-Vs-Two-Sided-Object-Note.) The areas on either side of a Surface-Generic are equal.

         The predicate Acts-In-Capacity indicates the capacity in which an agent participates in certain kinds of actions.  (Acts-In-Capacity AGENT ROLE SCRIPT-TYPE CAP) means that the agent AGENT plays the role ROLE in instances of SCRIPT-TYPE, and s/he does that role in the capacity CAP.  CAP is a Capacity-Attribute (q.v.) which describes the AGENT's mode of participation--e.g., as a job, hobby, main function, support function, etc.  Contrast three cases of acts of Greeting-Someone, when Performed-By: (1) instances of Receptionist, in their Job-Capacity and as their Main-Function; (2) instances of Flight-Attendant, in their Job-Capacity but as a Support-Function; and (3) instances of Train-Engineer, in a Hobby-Capacity (though they do it while working, it's not part of their job).

         The distinction between Head-Of-Government and Head-Of-State is a subtle one.  Head-Of-Government is the set of Leaders who actually run the government.  Head-Of-State is the set of Leaders who are mainly ceremonial figures, fulfilling diplomatic roles such as hosting foreign dignitaries.  For a given Country, these two roles may be filled by the same person, such as Bill-Clinton for the United-States-Of-America in 1996, or by two separate individuals; for example, in 1996 the Head-Of-State for Great-Britain would be Queen-Elizabeth-II, while the Head-Of-Government would be John Major (Prime-Minister-Head-Of-Government).  Cyc constant names indicate which government role is associated with a particular title; e.g., Sultan-Head-Of-Government vs. Sultan-Head-Of-State.

         Minutes-Duration is a function that takes one or two numbers and returns, as its value, some amount of Time.  An expression of the form (Minutes-Duration ?min ?max) denotes a quantity of Time that is at least ?min minutes and at most ?max minutes.  An expression of the form (Minutes-Duration ?num) denotes a quantity of Time that is exactly ?num minutes.

         (Skill-Required ACT-TYPE OTHER-TYPE PERF-ATT LEVEL) means that if one is to successfully perform an instance of some kind of action (ACT-TYPE), then one must be capable of performing instances of another kind of action (OTHER-TYPE) with the performance attribute PERF-ATT at a level of at least LEVEL.  For example, (Skill-Required PlayingVolleyball ServingAVolleyball Competence Low).  If you can't even serve a volleyball at a `Low' competence level, you're not so much `playing' volleyball as developing the skills to play it.

         (Feels-Towards-Object AGT OBJ EMOTYPE DEGREE) means that the Intelligent-Agent AGT feels a feeling of the Feeling-Attribute-Type EMOTYPE towards the Individual OBJ, with intensity DEGREE.
Note: the first argument can be a non-human intelligent agent, such as a dog or a company, because we often ascribe feelings and emotions to them, and they often behave consistently with having such feelings and emotions.

         (Orientation OBJECT Horizontal-Orientation) means that OBJECT is horizontal with respect to the current instance of Frame-Of-Reference.  A linear (Long-And-Thin) object is horizontal if and only if its longest axis lies in the horizontal plane.  A planar (Sheet-Shaped) object is horizontal if and only if its two longest axes lie in the horizontal plane.  Typically, horizontal objects include dinner plates, mousepads, ice skating rinks, parking lots, and stratus clouds.

         Calendar-Seasons are defined by the Gregorian calendar and are synchronized with the equinoxes and solstices.  Season-Of-Year instances are climatic seasons, events characterized by the weather in a given region.  The relationship between Season-Of-Year instances and Calendar-Seasons depends upon the hemisphere (or, more precisely, upon the lattitude.)  In the northern hemisphere, north of the tropics, a Calendar-Summer will significantly intersect with the a Summer-Season each year.   But in the southern hemisphere, that same Calendar-Summer (which is the same in both hemispheres) will intersect with what is locally, weatherwise, a Winter-Season.

         If there are two arguments to a Unit-Of-Measure function, as in (Meter 5 6), the first number is interpreted as the (inclusive) minimum, and the second number as the (inclusive) maximum.  Thus, (Meter 5 6) means `between 5 and 6 meters long, inclusive'.  If only one argument follows an element of Unit-Of-Measure, as in (Meter 3), it is interpreted as a shorthand for (Meter 3 3).  In other words, (Meter 3 3) means `exactly 3 meters'.  When a function belonging to Unit-Of-Measure is applied to a single argument, the value it returns must be an element of Scalar-Point-Value.

         Gen-Value-Fn is a Cyc function, in particular, an element of Individual-Denoting-Function.  It is used to denote an amount of a specified attribute that can be considered a generic value (very low, low, medium, high, or etc.) for members of the indicated group.  Thus, (Gen-Value-Fn PRED COL GEN) denotes the amount which can be considered the GEN value of PRED for members of the Collection COL.  Thus (Gen-Value-Fn Height-Of-Object Basket-Ball-Player High) denotes the amount of distance which is a high height among basketball players.  See also Generic-Attribute.

         Predicates in Cyc are organized into collections.  While some, like :Slot, are logically well-founded and are referenced in axioms and in the code which implements Cyc, others, though based on some intuitively plausible criteria, are involved in few (if any) axioms and are therefore not integral to Cyc's ontology.  Collections which fall into the latter class are generally under review at this time and are flagged with this Shared-Notes.

Another use of it is to express the fact that animals are virtually always breathing:  (Frequency-Of-Action-Type Breathing Vertebrate Bodily-Doer Continuously).  Even more interesting examples of this predicate express the the rules of thumb that in a modern Western personal... context a person engages in a toothbrushing event about once a day, while as the recipient of professional service that happens 0.5 - 4 times per year, while as the provider of such a service that happens 4 - 20 times per day.  Those three axioms would be written -- in the appropriate contexts of course -- (Frequency-Of-Action-Type Teeth-Cleaning Person Performed-By (Times-Per-Day 1)) and (Frequency-Of-Action-Type Teeth-Cleaning Person Recipient-Of-Service (Times-Per-Year 0.5 4)) and (Frequency-Of-Action-Type Teeth-Cleaning Person Provider-Of-Service (Times-Per-Day 4 20)).   Two additional notes are in order about this predicate:
Note that ?X must be a set of Situations [there is an argument constraint on this predicate that enforces this, namely (Arg1-Genl Frequency-Of-Action-Type Situation)],.
Note that this predicate is functional in its fourth argument position.  That is, given a legal set of values for ?X, ?Y, and ?R, there is one and only one meaningful value for the frequency ?F [this is specified by the Cyc axiom (Functional-In-The-Nth-Arg Frequency-Of-Action-Type 4)].

         One of the basic physical states of matter.  Semi-solid objects are characterized at the macroscopic level by (a) their ability to flow under the application of pressure, combined with (b) their high viscosity.  Examples of things that are typically in this State-Of-Matter: a squirt of toothpaste on your brush, or a lump of bread dough, at normal room temperatures.  At higher temperatures:  a lava flow, a lump of molten glass about to be blown into a vase, etc.

         (Axis-Fn OBJ REGIONTYP REGIONTYP) is a function that, applied to an individual object OBJ and two types of region of such an object, returns the axis through the object, determined by running the axis through the individual regions (of those types) of the object.  Thus Axis-Fn is an  Individual-Denoting-Function that returns a particular axis of an individual object. (Axis-Fn OBJ FROM-SIDE TO-SIDE) denotes a directional axis, pointing from FROM-SIDE to TO-SIDE of OBJ and extending through it. For example, (Axis-Fn `Chair37' Back-Side Front-Side) would denote the back-to-front axis of Chair37. See also Intrinsic-Axis-Of-Object.

         The attribute which specifies that persons X and Y have met each other at least once, and probably would be able to recall this, and even recognize each other, if they meet again.  I.e., (Acquaintances X Y Simple-Contact-Acquaintance) implies (Acquaintances Y X Simple-Contact-Acquaintance); that is, if X has met Y, then Y has met X.  This assumes that there was a meeting event in which (earlier subabstractions of) X and Y interacted, that both were minimally conscious, etc.

         (Between-On-Path X Y Z PATH) means that X, Y and Z are points on the path PATH and X is between Y and Z.  Note that this gives no ordering of Y and Z; it just claims that X is between them.  Note: Given a Path-Customary PATH and points or places on PATH, Between-On-Path does not in general determine a linear order (Totally-Ordered-Set) on the set of all points on PATH when PATH is not part of a specified Path-System.  However, in a Path-System SYS, Between-On-Path does determine a linear order on the set of all points on PATH in SYS.

         The measurement function used in Cyc to represent the basic unit of mass in the British (FPS) system.  Technically, the FPS pound is exclusively a unit of force, analogous to the Newton in the MKS system.  The usage here is occasioned primarily by the fact that interconversions between pounds and kilograms are often used in the terrestrial frame of reference.  In fact, the FPS unit of mass, analogous to the Kilogram in the MKS system, is called the 'slug'.  See also FPS-Unit-Of-Measure, Unit-Of-Measure, Pound-Unit-Of-Force.

         This predicate relates performers to particular individual actions.  (Performance-Level OBJ EVT ROLE PERF-ATT LEVEL) means that the individual OBJ plays the role ROLE in the action EVT, and does so with the performance attribute PERF-ATT to the degree LEVEL.  Such an assertion expresses actual performance in a particular action; for example, (Performance-Level Joe DiggingHole54001 Performed-By Strength Low) means Joe exerted a low level of strength while digging that particular hole.  This does not imply much about Joe's potential to exert strength, about strength required in general for hole-digging, etc., it just talks about that one single event.  To talk about typical or expected performance, use Skill-Level.

         In some contexts, users may wish to ground elements of Generic-Value-Function by linking them to numeric `real world' measurements.  E.g. In a driving-on-the-highway-context, one might wish to define (Medium-Amount-Fn Speed) as `between 50 and 60 miles per hour'.  The way to assert this is as follows:  (:and (Min-Quant-Value (Medium-Amount-Fn Speed) (Miles-Per-Hour 50))(Max-Quant-Value (Medium-Amount-Fn Speed)(Miles-Per-Hour 60))).

      <rdfs:comment>
         Which instrument predicate you use depends on what level of generality you wish your statement to apply at.  One help is to look at the argument types of each instrument predicate and decide.  Do you want it to apply to every Partially-Tangible which is an instrument?  Then use Instrument-Generic since Partially-Tangible is its Arg1-Isa.  Are you writing a rule which really only applies to Physical-Devices  Then use Device-Used.  But be careful!  When you use a more specific predicate such as Device-Used it may have special extra conditions in its definition aside from the Physical-Device Arg1-Isa constraint.  Also if your first stab at the rule involves Device-Used in the antecedent, see if it applies more generally to Instrument-Generic.

         Argument positions of Cyc predicates may have specified formats that constrain how many and what kind of terms may occupy that position, given some fixed set of terms in the other argument positions of the predicate.  If a predicate P has Parts-Format for argument position N, then given some particular set of terms that occupy the other argument positions of P, there may be multiple assertions with different terms in position N (keeping the other arguments fixed), but only so long as the terms in position N are all Physical-Parts of the same Partially-Tangible.  For example, the Arg1-Format of Physical-Parts is Parts-Format.  This allows us to represent that JosephsRightThumbnail is a Physical-Parts of JosephsRightThumb, of JosephsRightHand, and of Joseph.  This is more restrictive than Set-The-Format, which allows multiple unrelated values.  In contrast, specifying only (Arg1-Format Physical-Parts Set-The-Format) would not prevent JosephsRightThumb from being a Physical-Parts of both JosephsRightHand and of JamesRightHand.

         The predicate Point-Of-Contact-Info allows us to characterize a string of information as belonging to a certain kind of contact location for a particular person, without actually reifying those contact locations.  (Point-Of-Contact-Info AGENT LOC-TYPE INFO-TYPE STRING) means that AGENT's contact locations of type LOC-TYPE (e.g., Workplace) have STRING as their contact address of INFO-TYPE (e.g., Phone-Number-Text, Fax-Number-Text, Address-Text).  For example, to say that Keith Goolsbey's home phone number is 512-123-4567, we write: (Point-Of-Contact-Info Goolsbey Human-Residence Phone-Number-Text ``(512) 123-4567'').  Note: the disadvantage of this shorthand method is that all of AGENT's contact locations of the type LOC-TYPE are assumed to have the same STRING of INFO-TYPE.

An Agreement may contain a set of Obligations on the part of one or more of the parties. An Agreement may also be just a set of beliefs that the parties have decided to share. To indicate which propositions are true in an Agreement, regardless of whether they are true in reality, use Ist-Agreement. (Ist-Agreement AGREEMENT PROP) means that PROP is a Cyc-Formula expressing something that was agreed upon in AGREEMENT. Other relevant vocabulary: (Agreeing-Agents AGREEMENT AGENT) means that AGENT is one of the parties agreeing to AGREEMENT. (Sub-Agreements AGREEMENT1 AGREEMENT2) means that AGREEMENT2 is a part of (is included in) AGREEMENT1. (Governed-By-Agreement ACTION AGREEMENT) means that ACTION is governed by the terms of AGREEMENT. (Agreement-Forbids AGREEMENT AGENT ACTION-TYPE) means that AGREEMENT forbids AGENT from performing elements of ACTION-TYPE.

         If the predicate P has entry format Sub-Abs for one of its argument positions N, then, given some fixed set of arguments in the other positions, mutiple assertions may be added to the KB so long as each term appearing in argument position N is a Sub-Abstrac of some common Entity. Note that the case where the entity itself appears as arg N is allowed, since for all x, (Sub-Abstrac X X) is true.  Let's consider an example.  The Arg2-Format of Later-Sub-Abstractions is Sub-Abs.  Thus Cyc will allow one to assert that Later-Sub-Abstractions of SamZilkerAsATeenager include SamZilkerAsAnAdult, and SamZilkerDuringHisFirstMarriage, etc., so long as all of those are known to be subabstractions of the very same entity, in this case the one representing Sam Zilker.

         Arguments to Cyc predicates may have specified formats that constrain their values.  Interval-Entry is the format used to constrain argument positions that must be filled with measurable quantities.  If Interval-Entry is the entry format of some Nth argument to a predicate PRED, then all assertions with PRED that contain the same particular values in their other arguments must have, in the Nth (i.e., Interval-Entry) argument, quantitative values that `overlap'.  (See Scalar-Interval.)  Interval-Entry is provided because, for functional arguments like the second argument to Volume-Of-Object, we know that a single `real' value does exist, though we may have various ways of concluding limits on that value in the form of intervals.  As long as all the intervals overlap, those assertions are not contradictory.  For more explanation, see Format and the related predicates Arg1-Format, Arg2-Format, etc.

         Given a path PATH and different points X and Y on it, (Sub-Path-Between-Fn PATH X Y) gives a unique subpath SUB of PATH that is between X and Y.  This function should not be used without the context of a Path-System because only with the reference to a path system can we be certain about the existence of such a subpath (e.g., Austin and Texas are different points on I-35, but there is no subpath of I35 that is between Austin and Texas).  To put this in another way, let SYS be any path system.  If PATH is a path in SYS and X and Y are different points in SYS and are also points on PATH, (Sub-Path-Between-Fn PATH X Y) is the only subpath (in SYS) of PATH that is between X and Y.  See Path-In-System.  Note that this function is not defined on the cartesian product Path-Simple x Thing x Thing, but on a proper subset of it.

      <rdfs:comment>
         If one wishes to state a fact M about an assertion A, i.e. if one wishes to assert the meta-assertion M(A) and if A canonicalizes into multiple assertions, a_1, a_2...a_n,then one must do a non-standard procedure.  Due to the way the canonicalizer currently (Nov 96) handles meta-assertions, rather than simply asserting M(A), one must distribute the meta-assertion over the results of canonicalization.  That is one must assert M(a_1), M(a_2)...M(a_n). Consider the following example:  Suppose one wanted to assert 
`if a movement occurs then there is a friction Sub-Events, unless the movement is frictionless.'
The way one asserts this is by first asserting the fact without the `unless', i.e.

(ke-assert '(:=&gt;
	     (:Direct-Types ?MOV Movement-Event)
              (:Exists ?FRIC
	      (:and
	       (:Direct-Types ?FRIC Friction-Process)
	       (Sub-Events ?MOV ?FRIC)))) Base-KB)

Because there is an :and with two literals on the right hand side of this rule it canonicalizes into two assertions which then become part of the KB.  One must next find these assertions as they appear in the KB:

(:=&gt;
 (:and
  (:Direct-Types ?MOV Movement-Event)
  (Term-Of-Unit ?FRIC-EVENT146 (SKF-29707602 ?MOV)))
 (:Direct-Types ?FRIC-EVENT146 Friction-Process))

(:=&gt;
 (:and
  (:Direct-Types ?MOV Movement-Event)
  (Term-Of-Unit ?FRIC-EVENT146 (SKF-29707602 ?MOV)))
 (Sub-Events ?MOV ?FRIC-EVENT146)).

Now using these one may state the `unless' part of the rule:

(ke-assert
  '(Except-When
    (:Direct-Types ?MOV Frictionless-Motion)
    (:=&gt;
     (:and
      (:Direct-Types ?MOV Movement-Event)
      (Term-Of-Unit ?FRIC-EVENT146 (SKF-29707602 ?MOV)))
     (:Direct-Types ?FRIC-EVENT146 Friction-Process)))
  Base-KB)

(ke-assert
  '(Except-When
    (:Direct-Types ?MOV Frictionless-Motion)
    (:=&gt;
     (:and
      (:Direct-Types ?MOV Movement-Event)
      (Term-Of-Unit ?FRIC-EVENT146 (SKF-29707602 ?MOV)))
     (Sub-Events ?MOV ?FRIC-EVENT146)))

  Base-KB).

This Shared-Note is true about any Relationship which has Assertion as an argument type.

         An attribute of a surface meaning that it is bumped or indented inward.  A concave surface has a pair of points which are both closer to a viewer than points on the surface between them.   Dependinhg on the context, it may have relatively small subregions which have convexities (e.g. wrinkles, small dents, corrugations) or are flat so long as the overall shape is concave.  Saddle-shapes, although convex in certain dimensions, are concave in others and are therefore concave.

         (Sensory-Response EVT ROLE SENSTYPE DEGREE) means that a Perceptual-Agent who participates in the Physical-Event EVT in the manner ROLE has an immediate sensory reaction of the Sensory-Reaction-Type SENSTYPE with DEGREE of intensity. For example, Cyc's knowledge base contains a rule that says that if $E is a touching-something-very-cold event, then (Sensory-Response $E Done-By Level-Of-Discomfort Positive) --- i.e., that whoever does that touching action is likely to feel some discomfort. Note that Sensory-Response is one of the few predicates that are quaternary; i.e., that take four arguments.

      <rdfs:comment>
         When to use :Direct-Types, Main-Constituent, or Constituents.  We develop the following example as a basis for explaining the differences.  

Consider X, where (:Direct-Types X Water). If we add some other substance(s) to X, to the point where the mixture acquires some salient characteristic(s) different from Water while retaining all the main properties, then we should assert (Main-Constituent X W), where W is the original water -- i.e., (:Direct-Types W Water) -- and X is the whole new mixture of W with some other stuff(s).  Suppose we add enough enough other stuff that the physical properties of the mixture become significantly different from those of water; then we should assert only (Constituents X W).  

:Direct-Types - Use :Direct-Types if X would commonly be referred to as `water', including cases in which a small number of minor characteristics are different due to some admixture.   

Examples (arguably, 3 and 4 are borderline cases): 

1. An instance of (Pure-Fn Water) :Direct-Types Water.  
2. An instance of Water-Ingestible :Direct-Types Water (but may have trace constituents).
3. An instance of Pool-Water :Direct-Types Water (but has some Chlorine as a salient Constituents). 
4. An instance of Sea-Water :Direct-Types Water (but has some Salt-Na-Cl as a salient Constituents).  


Main-Constituent - Use Main-Constituent when X contains other substances besides water, would NOT commonly referred to as `water', and yet has MOST of the material properties of water.  As a rule, most of the properties of the Main-Constituent transfer to the substance it's a part of.  Often such substances have at least one important and/or perceptible characteristic (due to admixture) that is quite different from the properties of water.  

Examples: 

1. An instance of Lemonade is NOT called `water' but has water as a Main-Constituent.  It tastes quite different from water.  It has nutritional (caloric) value.  It is a human-made beverage.  
2. An instance of Coffee-Beverage is NOT called `water' but has water as a Main-Constituent.  It tastes quite different from water.  It contains caffeine.  Also, a specific inference about coffee's (lack of) transparency should override the transparency which would otherwise be inferred from the material properties of its Main-Constituent.  
3. Aqueous hydrochloric acid has many of the properties of its main constituent, water -- for example, transparency, viscosity, density, freezing point, etc.  But it also has the very important difference that it is highly acidic, caustic, etc. -- and attributing to it water's potability would be disastrous.

Constituents - Use Constituents when X is NOT commonly referred to as `water' and has FEW properties of water, even though X contains water.  

Examples:

1. An instance of (Solid-Fn Gelatin) is NOT called `water', and though it has water among its Constituents, gelatin has very few of the properties of water. 
2. An instance of Concrete is NOT called `water'; though it has water among its Constituents, it has none of the salient characteristics of water.
3. An instance  of Mud is NOT called `water' and has few characteristics of water, though water is among its Constituents.  Its Main-Constituent is some portion of Soil.

         An attribute of an object with respect to an Agent, meaning that the Agent has non-exclusive use of the object.  All Agents can claim this use-right to an object if any Agent can.  This attribute is not the same as Group-User-Rights-Attribute, as there is no specific group to which Agents must belong in order to claim this right.  This is typically used for things so fundamental we hardly consider them `rights.'  E.g., the right to breathe air, use public parking lots, walk the streets as a free person, drive on public roads, etc.  If you think about it, though, you'll realize that there is an implicit `group' that can exercise each of those rights.  So think of it this way:  one can define the group explicitly as a group, and then assert that each member has Group-User-Rights-Attribute (e.g., the group of licensed drivers has the right to drive on public roads), or one could define a context, a Microtheory, in which performers of actions defaulted to members of that group, and in that context the right (e.g., the right to drive on a public road) would be a Non-Exclusive-User-Rights.

         Elements of Unit-Of-Measure-No-Prefix denote units of measure that don't have a multiplicative prefix (e.g. `kilo', `micro', `billion').  Inch and Meters-Per-Second are such elements.  On the other hand, elements of Unit-Of-Measure-With-Prefix do have multiplicative prefixes; examples include Centimeters-Per-Second, (Micro Gram), Kilo-Watt, and Grams-Per-Milliliter.  We need these constants in order to prevent references to terms such as ((Micro (Micro Gram)) 5) or ((Kilo (Centimeters-Per-Second)) 3.2).  If we didn't have these restrictions, equal quantities would allow for an undesirable level of possible names for a quantity, e.g. ((Micro (Kilo Gram)) 1) would refer to the same quantity as ((Kilo (Micro Gram)) 1) would refer to the same quantity as (Gram .001), etc.

         The Cyc predicate Feels-Response-On-Body-Region is used to represent localized somatic feelings of a perceptive being. (Feels-Response-On-Body-Region AGT BODYPARTTYPE SENS DEGREE) means that the Perceptual-Agent AGT feels on its body, in the area specified by BODYPARTTYPE, the sensory reaction SENS with an intensity of DEGREE.  For example, Cyc's knowledge base contains an assertion that the very same part of one's body doesn't feel both hot and cold at the same time.  Feels-Response-On-Body-Region can also be used to state symptoms, e.g., when you're feverish, your head feels hot.  See also Sensory-Reaction-Type.

         The formula
  (Except-When
    P(?x0 ... ?xn)
    Q(?x0 ... ?xn)))

states that, in situations where assertion Q would apply to a set of
bindings for variables ?x0 ... ?xn, the conclusion is allowed 
`except when'
  P(?x0 ... ?xn)
is true for these variable bindings.  The formula
  (Except-For [term] Q(?x0))
states that, in situations where assertion Q would apply to a variable
?x0, the conclusion is allowed `except for' the situations where [term]
is the binding for ?x0.  To be well-formed, Q must be a rule with
exactly one free variable.

By definition, Except-For is merely syntactic sugar:
  (Except-For [term] Q(?x0)) 
  &lt;=&gt; 
  (Except-When (equals ?x0 [term]) Q(?x0))
Since an Except-When statement is a meta-statement about some rule 
Q(?x0 ... ?xn), the statement is not well-formed if Q(?x0 ... ?xn) is
not already an assertion in the KB.  Also, strictly speaking, P and Q in
the Except-When merely must share some variables rather than all
variables as it's been written above.

These constructs replace `abnormal' at the EL (epistemological level).  Old assertions of the form:

  (:=&gt;
    P(?x0 ... ?xn)
    (abnormal R(?x0 ... ?xn) Q(?x0 ... ?xn)))

become:

  (Except-When
    P(?x0 ... ?xn)
    Q(?x0 ... ?xn))

The predicate `abnormal' has not actually gone away, but was modified for use as the HL (Heuristic Level) implementation of Except-When.  Like Term-Of-Unit, `abnormal' should be viewed as an inference-maintained predicate, and human beings should not be manually asserting things using `abnormal.'

         Plus-Fn is Cyc's addition operator; it is a variable-arity mathematical function.  Plus-Fn takes a variable number of quantities as arguments, and it yields a new quantity which is the result of adding those arguments together.  All of the arguments to Plus-Fn must be elements of Scalar-Interval, as is its result.  Examples: (Plus-Fn 2 3 4) returns 9; (Plus-Fn (Meter 1.5) (Meter 0.7)) returns (Meter 2.2).

         Argument places of Cyc predicates may have specified formats that constrain their values.  Single-Entry is a format constraint used to indicate that there is at most one value in a certain argument place, when all other arguments are fixed.  For example, the Arg2-Format  of Mother is Single-Entry, since an animal can only have one mother.  See also Format, and contrast with Set-The-Format.

         Unity is the standard unit of measure for dimensionless quantities.  Like other elements of Unit-Of-Measure, Unity is a variable-arity function whose (one or two) arguments are instances of Real-Number.  Unlike most other elements of Unit-Of-Measure, Unity returns a dimensionless quantity, simply a real number without physical dimensions attached.  Thus, the value of (Unity .10) is equal to the point scalar 0.10, which is also the same quantity as (Percent 10).  Both (Unity .10) and 0.10 are legitimate instances of Real-Number; however, only 0.10 is a legitimate element of Real-Number (q.v.).  Unity can be used to return a dimensionless real-number interval as well as a point value; e.g., (Unity 3 4) returns the interval that is the range of numbers between 3 and 4, inclusive.

         The predicate Intended-Meaning is used to relate English words to their denotations within the Cyc Knowledge Base.  Some words have multiple denotations associated with different word senses, which may or may not occur in the same parts of speech. (Intended-Meaning WORD PART NUM CONST) means that the denotation of WORD, with part of speech PART and word sense number NUM, is the Cyc constant CONST.  Examples: (1) Place-The-Word, an instance of English-Word, has the denotation Putting-Something-Somewhere when used as a Verb with its word sense 0, and the denotation Place when used as a Simple-Noun with that same word sense; (2) Ring-The-Word currently has four Intended-Meaning assertions in the KB: Emitting-Sound (as a Verb with its 1st word sense); Audible-Sound (as a Simple-Noun with its 1st word sense); Ring-Shape (as a Simple-Noun with its 0th word sense); and Ring-Jewelry (as a Simple-Noun with its 2nd word sense).  Note that Intended-Meaning may reference the results of Cyc functions, as well as Cyc constants; e.g., Density-The-Word denotes (Interval-Min-Fn (Low-Amount-Fn Density)).  See also Word-Sense, Speech-Part.

         An attribute of an object with respect to an Agent, meaning that the agent who holds this kind of User-Rights-Attribute to an object is allowed to use that object in events where it performs its Primary-Function.  A rental agreement typically gives the renter this kind of right to use of an object (such as a car, residence, videotape, etc.)  Just because you rent a car, though, does not give you the right to sell it, burn it up, or repaint it.

         Seconds are the standard unit of Time in Cyc.  Think of Seconds-Duration as a function; it takes one or two numbers and returns, as its value, some amount of Time.   An expression of the form (Seconds-Duration ?num) denotes a quantity of Time that is exactly ?num seconds long.  An expression of the form (Seconds-Duration ?min ?max) denotes a quantity of Time that is at least ?min seconds at most ?max seconds long.
Note:  Cyc's ontology contains ways to specify nonuniform distributions (e.g., a normal distribution with a mean and standard deviation), but for most purposes this simple uniform specification of `a piece of time' has proven itself to be the most useful building block.

         (Link-Between-In-System LINK X Y SYS) means that in the Path-System SYS, LINK (a link in SYS) has its two end points X and Y (nodes in SYS).  A link in a path system is one of the paths in the system whose end points are nodes in the system and that have no other nodes along them.  For each link LINK in SYS, there is a unique pair {X, Y} of different nodes in SYS such that (Link-Between-In-System LINK X Y SYS) and (Link-Between-In-System LINK Y X SYS) hold, and for two points (nodes) in SYS, there could be several different ('parallel') links between them.  No point in SYS that is not a node can be an end point of a link.  If node X is an end-point of LINK and (Link-Between-In-System LINK X Y SYS) holds, then (Point-On-Path X LINK) holds.  A link in SYS may have many points on it other than its end-points, but these points cannot be nodes in SYS (another way to put this is to say that there are exactly two nodes on a link, though there can be any number, greater than 1, of points on the link).  Only nodes in SYS can be 'intersection' point in SYS (see Junction-In-System), which implies that there is, in the system SYS, no point on a link LINK between X and Y that is an 'intersection' point of LINK and another link or a loop.  When defining a path system, it is convenient (and also quite safe) to start with a name of the system, say SYS1 (with an assertion (:Direct-Types SYS1 Path-System)), and enter the names of links in SYS, say Link1, Link2 etc. (with assertions (:Direct-Types Link1 Path-Simple) etc.), and then only enter assertions of the form (Link-Between-In-System LINK X Y SYS1) for each link in SYS1 and its end points X and Y--the rules related to a path systems will generate assertions like (Node-In-System X SYS1), (Point-In-System X SYS1), (Link-In-System LINK SYS1) and (Path-In-System LINK SYS1) etc.  If one later needs to add something else to the system, say a point A on a link LINK other than its end nodes X and Y, he/she may further enter (Between-On-Path A X Y LINK) and (Point-In-System A SYS1) without changing anything else.  Note that (Link-Between-In-System LINK X Y SYS) is actually an abbreviation of (:and (Link-In-System LINK SYS) (Node-In-System X SYS) (Node-In-System Y SYS) (Path-Between LINK X Y)).

         A physical attribute.  Pourable is the structural attribute of a tangible thing that is capable of flowing.  Pourable things don't have intrinsic shape, but instead take the shape of their containers.  When acted on by a force, a Pourable thing changes shape at a rate proportional to the force.  (In addition, Pourable things may be easily separated into multiple pieces; however, such a separation is not a breaking or shearing.)  Semisolid mobs of particles, such as portions of sand or snow, are Pourable; but a gelatin-like semisolid is not.  See also Semi-Solid-Tangible-Thing.
