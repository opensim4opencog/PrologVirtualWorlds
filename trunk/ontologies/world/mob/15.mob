allah god yahweh~
Allah~
You resist the urge to avert your eyes from the sight of the one true God.
~
The sight is for each man a different, a mirror into the true nature of
each person's body and soul.  At first a proud, bitter old man, but just
as easily a gentle extended hand, a smile, and gardens... gardens.

Michael~
The archangel Michael turns and begins to look you over.

that too fades, and you see nothing.

Raphael~
The archangel Raphael looks up and frowns at you in disapproval.
~
It is impossible to get a solid glance at the archangel.  He is nothing
that is human, and with a mere whisper, he dispels every image that you
attempt to create in your mind.

A mad, drunken jester is sitting here, lost in his deepening stupor.

He is dimly aware of your gaze.  Chuckling softly, you hear him mutter
something obscure: dragons, the temple, the falling of great empires.
He laughs at you and takes another drink.

said to be trapped in lamps and bottles, capable of granting all kinds of
powerful wishes.  To you, it looks like nothing more than an annoying little
sprite.

the slumped old man~
A slumped, shaking old man stands up and begins to yell at the world.
~
He wears a faded uniform, decorated with honors of his own creation,
slackened jaws and pasty white bags sagging under his ugly, hating eyes.
A tuft of reckless dark hair scatters across his forehead, and his right
hand shakes and shakes.

so charming.

He was chosen as leader by a clique of jealous rivals who could agree
upon no other.  The memory of the Prophet fading quickly from the minds
of the faithful, he could do little, and was in the end killed by his
enemies.

Ali~
You have come before Ali, fourth and last of the Rashidun.
~
Some view him as the closest to God among all of the Caliphs, the one
most deserving of our respect and reverence.  Still others saw him as
a schismatic, a heretic, one to be killed and forgotten.  To look at
him now is for you to decide for yourself.

temptations that will be yours if you in turn but follow him.
