King Welmar~
The wise King Welmar sits here in his throne.

In his later middle-age, with his beard starting to grey, King Welmar

Peter, the Captain of the Royal Guard, walks around inspecting.

As all members of the Guard, Peter wears the chain mail required of

you realise none of them would stand a chance against this man in a
fight.  He stands at least two metres tall, but still moves with an
almost feline grace.  He actually radiates strength and confidence,
and you have to fight a sudden urge to come to attention as you see
him.

Ergan the Murderer~
Slumped in a corner you see Ergan, aka the Murderer of Townsbridge.
~
You remember a time almost a decade ago, when the news of the day
was how this man had slaughtered the entire population of the little
village of Townsbridge.  He was imprisoned, and here he is - a shadow
of the undoubtedly great warrior he once was, but still to be reckoned
with.
