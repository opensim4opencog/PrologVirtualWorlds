It has been used in combat by the Russian army in Afghanistan, and apparently by armies of both Iraq and Kuwait during Desert Storm. In addition to Russian manufacture, it is also manufactured under license by India (and known as the `Sarath') and in the former Czechoslovakia. Russia was marketing the BMP-2 for $200,000 in 1993. It is amphibious, floating and being propelled on the water by its tracks. BMP-2's are associated primarily with Red mechanized infantry units (rather than armored units), at least at the battalion level. At higher levels, various types of divisions may have lower-level components of several types, so mechanized infantry (with BMP-2s) and armored (with T-64 tanks, for instance) may very well be found in the same division.")

For example, it may be fairly said that Grenades are designed to target a wide range of types--military personnel, ConstructionArtifacts, ArmoredVehicles, and maybe one or two other things besides. However, the collection-union of MilitaryPerson, ConstructionArtifact, and ArmoredVehicle probably has little intrinsic utility attaching to it, which is an argument against having an intendedTargetTypeOfWeaponType asserted for Grenade.

Making the second argument transitive or inverse-transitive via genls would defeat this purpose. More subtly, making the first argument transitive or inverse-transitive via genls would too, because once an intended target type had been inherited to a more specific or a more general weapon type, it would become impossible to assert a more specific target type for the more specific weapon type, or a more general target type for the more general weapon type, which one might very well want to do.")
