<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b><a name=SEC596></a><a href="#TOC596">Java
  event handling from Prolog</a></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Java event handling is based on a delegation
  model since version 1.1.x. This approach to event handling is very powerful
  and elegant, but a user program cannot handle all the events that can arise on
  a given object: for each kind of event, a listener must be implemented and
  added specifically. However, the Java 2 API includes a special listener (<code>AWTEventListener</code>)
  that can manage the internal java event queue.</font> 
  </p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The prolog to java interface has been designed
  to emulate the java event handler, and is also based on event objects and
  listeners. The low level prolog to java interface implements its own event
  manager, to handle those events that have prolog listeners associated to the
  object that raises the event. From the prolog side can be added listeners to
  objects for specific events. The java side includes a list of goals to launch
  from the object and event type.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Due to the events nature, the event handler
  must work in a separate thread to manage the events asynchronously. The java
  side has its own mechanisms to work this way. The prolog side must be
  implemented specially for event handling using threads. The communication
  between java and prolog is also asynchronous, and an additional socket stream
  is used to avoid interferences with the main socket stream. The event stream
  will work in this implementation only in one way: from java to prolog. If an
  event handler needs to send back requests to java, it will use the main socket
  stream, just like the requests sent directly from a prolog program.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The internal process of register a Prolog event
  handler to a Java event is shown in the next figure:</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When an event raises, the low-level Prolog to
  Java interface has to send to the Prolog user program the goal to evaluate.
  Graphically, the complete process takes the tasks involved in the following
  figure:</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name=SEC595></a><a href="#TOC595"><b>Java side</b></a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In the implementation of the java side, two
  items must be carefully designed: the handling of java objects, and the
  representation of prolog data structures. The last item is specially important
  because all the interactions between prolog and java are made using prolog
  structures, an easy way to standardize the different data management of both
  languages. Even the requests themselves are encapsulated using prolog
  structures. The overload of this encapsulation is not significant in terms of
  socket traffic, due to the optimal implementation of the prolog serialized
  term.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The java side must handle the objects created
  from the prolog side dynamically, and these objects must be accessed as fast
  as possible from the set of objects. The java API provides a powerful
  implementation of Hash tables that achieves all the requirements of our
  implementation.</font> 
  </p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">On the other hand, the java representation of
  prolog terms is made using the inheritance of java classes. In the java side
  exists a representation of a generic prolog term, implemented as an abstract
  class in java. Variables, atoms, compound terms, lists, and numeric terms are
  classes in the java side which inherit from the term class. Java objects can
  be seen also under the prolog representation as compound terms, where the
  single argument corresponds to the Hash key of the actual java object in the
  Hash table referred to before. This behavour makes the handling of mixed java
  and prolog elements easy. Prolog goals are represented in the java side as
  objects which contain a prolog compound term with the term representing the
  goal. This case will be seen more in depth next, when the java to prolog is
  explained.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name=SEC597></a><a href="#TOC597"><b>Java
  exception handling from Prolog</b></a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name=IDX6023></a><a name=IDX6024></a>Java
  exception handling is very similar to the peer prolog handling: it includes
  some specific statements to trap exceptions from user code. In the java side,
  the exceptions can be originated from an incorrect request, or can be
  originated in the code called from the request. Both exception types will be
  sent to prolog using the main socket stream, allowing the prolog program
  manage the exception. However, the first kind of exceptions are prefixed, so
  the user program can distinguish them from the second type of exceptions.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In order to handle exceptions properly using
  the prolog to java and java to prolog interfaces simultaneously, in both sides
  of the interface will be filtered those exceptions coming from their own side:
  this avoids an endless loop of exceptions bouncing from one side to another.</font>
