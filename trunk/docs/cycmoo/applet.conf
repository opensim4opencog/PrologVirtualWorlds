# This is an example file how to configure the applet. It may contain
# any property defined in de/mud/jta/default.conf or by a plugin.
#

# First we define the plugins we want to use. Order is important here:
# the plugins are loaded according to their order. If you want to include
# a plugin twice you must give it an id to distinguish the configuration
# options later. Here two button bars are added and been giben the unique
# id '1' and '2' respectively. You may use any identifier you like, so it
# could be 'one' or 'two' as well. The id must be enclosed in braces after
# the name of the plugin.
plugins		=	Status,Socket,Telnet,ButtonBar(1),ButtonBar(2),Terminal

# For each visible plugin we have to tell the jta where to place that
# component. That is done using the 'layout.pluginName' property. Possible
# directions are 'North', 'South', 'East', 'West' and 'Center'. Keep in
# mind that you can only display one plugin per direction. So at there are
# only 5 visible plugins possible at one time.

# Any value, regardless of true or false can be used, existence of this
# property is enough.
