An ASTAMIDS is employed on an aerial platform to gather minefield intelligence over specific areas or along routes.  Aerial platforms may be unmanned (UAV) or manned (helicopter).  Types of minefields located are surface patterned, buried patterned, scatterable, and nuisance mines on unpaved roads. Information gathered during these missions provides indicators or minefield presence, location, and boundaries.  After detecting a mine or mines (called the initial detection), the platform is directed to conduct a survey of the area using the S=ASTAMIDS system to determine minefield boundaries.  On a UAV, this information is transmitted to a Ground Control Station where it is processed in real-time.  This processed information, containing minefield locations, is transmitted to meneuver commanders.  ASTAMIDS assists the maneuver commander by identifying minefields to assist in determining courses of action (such as bypassing mined areas or planning breaches).

Components of the bridge can be assembled to form piers which are used as intermidiate supports for long spans.  The BaileyBridge system is highly labor-intensive but also highly versatile.  In some cases, because it can be assembled in multiple heights and widths, it is the only tactical bridge suitable for long spans and heavy loads.  The basic bridge set contains enough parts and equipment to install two 80-foot double-single bridges or one 130-foot double-double bridge.

An instance of IrregularMilitaryForce is a military organization that is not regularly established, but rather, exists in connection with (and usually only for the duration of) a specific conflict or situation. A group member of an irregular military force might be a regular (instance of) MilitaryPerson who is assigned a special military task very different from his usual ones, or might be someone who is not regularly a MilitaryPerson at all but is nevertheless assigned a military task. Suppose a Central American army officer organized a group of villagers to help defend against an impending invasion; the group would for a time constitute a part of the country's irregular army force--which force would itself be an instance of (IrregularForcesFn Army-BranchOfService).")

(documentation Isolate-MilitaryTask "To isolate is to seal off both physically and psychologically an enemy force from his sources of support, to deny the enemy freedom of movement, and to prevent the enemy unit from having contact with other enemy forces. Physical and psychological isolation are interdependent factors. Once isolated, an enemy unit must not be allowed sanctuary within his present position. It is attacked as often as possible. Usually associated with encirclement operations, isolate as a task can be a part of a deliberate attack to facilitate the breach of an enemy's defensive perimeter. This leads to the resulting piecemeal destruction of the enemy force.")

With the use  of a Reinforcement Kit and two  sets of MGB, a 160-foot  span MLC 60 bridge can be constructed.  Although the MGB can withstand  MLC 70 loads, the effective life  of the bridge is  shortened from about 10,000 to 7,000 crossings.  The bridge set can also be used to  construct a variety of shorter span bridges.  The  rapid construction characteristics  of the MGB provide a capability which  can be used well  forward in the  main battle  area.  The MGB  and the BaileyBridge-Military are considered as   complementary systems,  each   satisfying  different  operational requirements.  The primary role of the MGB is for tactical bridging in the brigade area while  the BaileyBridge-Military is used  primarily as a lines  of  communication  bridge.  As   the  tactical situation permits, MGB  would be removed and replaced  by Bailey, timber or steel bridges.  (Source: Engineer Systems Handbook, 4/97)")
