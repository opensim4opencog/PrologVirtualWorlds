;;Added subclasses of 'Food' and subclasses of 'GeographicArea'
;;to cover new WordNet mappings.  Modified some of the temporal
;;concepts on the basis of Jerry Hobbs' revised desiderata.
;;Addressed Pierre Grenon's criticisms of the SUMO mereotopology.

;; ================================================
;;      SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology)
;; ================================================

;; This is the source file for the SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology), 
;; an ontology that was developed within the SUO Working Group by merging
;; the SUO "candidate content" sources and refining and extending this content on 
;; the basis of various knowledge engineering projects and input from the SUO 
;; Working Group.

;; The SUMO incorporates John Sowa's upper ontology (as described at 
;; http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/toplevel.htm and in Chapter 2 of his 
;; book _Knowledge Representation_, Brooks/Cole, 2000), Russell and Norvig's 
;; ontology, PSL (Process Specification Language), Casati and Varzi's theory of 
;; holes, Allen's temporal axioms, the relatively noncontroversial elements of 
;; Smith's and Guarino's respective mereotopologies, the KIF formalization of the 
;; CPR (Core Plan Representation), the ontologies available on the Ontolingua 
;; server maintained by Stanford University's Knowledge Systems Laboratory, the 
;; ontologies developed by ITBM-CNR, some of the spatial relations from an 
;; unpublished paper by Iris Tommelein and Anil Gupta entitled "Conceptual 
;; Structures for Spatial Reasoning", and a "Structural Ontology" proposed by 
;; David Whitten and substantially revised and extended by Chris Menzel.
;; Note that some of the subclasses of 'Process' in the SUMO were originally 
;; inspired by some of the verb classes from the second part of Beth Levin's book 
;; "English Verb Classes and Alternations:  A Preliminary Investigation."

;; The knowledge representation language in which the SUMO is expressed is SUO-KIF, 
;; which stands for "Standard Upper Ontology - Knowledge Interchange Format".  SUO-KIF 
;; is a simplified form of the popular KIF knowledge representation language.  A 
;; specification of SUO-KIF can be found at:  http://suo.ieee.org/suo-kif.html.  It 
;; should be noted that some of the axioms in the SUMO make use of row variables 
;; (indicated with a "@" prefix).  Such variables are not currently part of the SUO-
;; KIF specification, but they simplify matters significantly in some cases.  Details 
;; about row variables can be found in the following paper:  
;; http://reliant.teknowledge.com/IJCAI01/HayesMenzel-SKIF-IJCAI2001.pdf.

;; The SUMO is a modular ontology.  That is, the ontology is divided into 
;; self-contained subontologies.  Each subontology is indicated by a section 
;; header, and the dependencies between the subontologies are specified with 
;; statements of the form ";; INCLUDES '<SUBONTOLOGY>'".  These statements are 
;; found at the beginning of each section.  The dependencies between the 
;; various subontologies can also be graphed informally as follows:

some quantifiable aspect of the modeled world, such as 'the earth's 
diameter' (a constant length) and 'the stress in a loaded deformable 
solid' (a measure of stress, which is a function of three spatial 
coordinates).  All &%PhysicalQuantities are either &%ConstantQuantities 
or &%FunctionQuantities.  Instances of &%ConstantQuantity are dependent 
on a &%UnitOfMeasure, while instances of &%FunctionQuantity are 
&%Functions that map instances of &%ConstantQuantity to other instances 
of &%ConstantQuantity (e.g., &%TimeDependentQuantities are 
&%FunctionQuantities).  Although the name and definition of 
&%PhysicalQuantity is borrowed from physics, &%PhysicalQuantities need 
not be material.  Aside from the dimensions of length, time, velocity, 
etc., nonphysical dimensions such as currency are also possible.  
Accordingly, amounts of money would be instances of &%PhysicalQuantity.

as arguments.  For example, 3 &%Meters can be expressed as (&%MeasureFn 3 
&%Meter).  &%ConstantQuantities form a partial order (see 
&%PartialOrderingRelation) with the &%lessThan relation, since &%lessThan 
is a &%RelationExtendedToQuantities and &%lessThan is defined over the
