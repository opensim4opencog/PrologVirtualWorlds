<h1>Trying out LogicMOO...</h1>
<p>&nbsp;<p>The system is sometimes down or being recompiled and the previous
usernames and passwords may be reset.<br>
I intend to offer a stable connection point for persistent knowledge engineering
in a short while.<p>First Log in:&nbsp; <a href="telnet://216.39.172.56:8808/">telnet://216.39.172.56:8808</a><p>Create
a user name and password.&nbsp; You will be asked to create a MUD/MOO character.&nbsp;
You can change character's race and some other attributes at a latter time.<p>&nbsp;<p>Browse
to the Web Interface at <a href="http://216.39.172.56:666">http://216.39.172.56</a><p>Identify
your character and you will be asked again for your password (the same one from
the MOO).&nbsp;&nbsp; You web-theme setting is based on your character's
Job.&nbsp; (The 'Mage' theme is the only one being tested now)&nbsp;&nbsp; The
web interface primary function is to make things that would not be easily done
over telnet simpler.&nbsp; Such as exploring&nbsp; the object model and room
layouts.&nbsp; The rooms and objects present themselves on the web as
S-Expressions and minor bits of editing are possible.&nbsp; This will increase
as time goes on and feature requests are fulfilled.&nbsp; +<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
