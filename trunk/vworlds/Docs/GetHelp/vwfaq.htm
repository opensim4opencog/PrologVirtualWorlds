<a name = "Q1"><h4>When I right-click an avatar in the <b>Avatar</b> list or the
<b>Room Contents</b> list, the menu I see is different from the menu that
appears when I right-click an avatar in the graphical window.</h4></a>

<blockquote>
  <p>To pop up the same menu in these two lists as in the graphical window,
  you must click on an avatar with the <em>left</em> mouse button.
</blockquote>

<a name = "Q3"><h4>When I open the Client Logon page from the Start Menu Shortcut, I get an error
dialog box stating that &quot;the object doesn't support this property.&quot; <br>
- or -<br>
I get script security warnings when I try to load the logon page or enter a world.</h4></a>

<blockquote>
  <p>Both of these problems are related to control registration. See the question
  <strong>During installation, I get a message that some components
  failed to register</strong> in the Troubleshooting section of <tt>Readme.TXT</tt>.</p>
</blockquote>

<a name = "Q4"><h4>After the spinning cube, I see only avatars and a few other objects, but I don't see
any 3D geometry. The whole background is black.</h4></a>

<blockquote>
  <p>Entering a world and downloading its content are two separate actions. It's likely that,
  for some reason, the world is looking for its content in the wrong place. It is either
  looking on your local drive for nonexistent files, or on a web server that is not working.
  Check with the world administrator/owner/creator.</p>
</blockquote>

<a name = "Q5"><h4>Some of the graphics have weird colors, but they're not white.</h4></a>

<blockquote>
  <p>Check your display properties. Try setting the color depth to 16 bit
  or higher and see if that helps.  </p>
</blockquote>

<a name = "Q6"><h4>When running Virtual Worlds, my graphics window is much smaller than the space
allocated for it in the user interface.</h4></a>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are using too much of your computer's video memory by running it in a high color depth.
  Try reducing the color depth to a setting below 24 bit color.</p>
</blockquote>

<a name = "Q7"><h4>I created a large solid object and now I seem to be trapped inside it.</h4></a>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can either uncheck the object's <b>Is solid</b> property (on the <a href="../uiref/proppage/descrip.htm">
  <b>General Property Page</b></a> for the object), or create another
  object, move it outside the boundary of the object you are trapped in, and then
  select <b>Approach</b> the newly created object. </p>
</blockquote>

<a name = "Q8"><h4>What do I do when I get a message that says my avatar is corrupt?</h4></a>

<blockquote>
  <p>If an avatar has been corrupted, all you can do is delete it and start over.</p>
</blockquote>

<a name = "Q9"><h4>I logged on to a Virtual World as &quot;Bob&quot;, but when I entered the world, my
avatar name was &quot;Bob13&quot;.</h4></a>

<blockquote>
  <p>All avatars in Virtual Worlds must have unique identifying names. If other
  avatars have already logged on to a world with the name &quot;Bob&quot;, Virtual Worlds
  automatically resolves names of new avatars by adding a number to differentiate them from
  avatars already in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<a name = "Q10"><h4>I can't hear chat from other rooms. What's wrong?</h4></a>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is normal. A room forms a natural boundary in Virtual Worlds. You will not receive
  any information about a room unless you are in it, including chat taking place there.</p>
</blockquote>

<a name = "Q11"><h4>Someone is in the room but I can't hear his/her chat. Why?</h4></a>

<blockquote>
  <p>Did you add that avatar to your Ignored list? Ignored
  avatars do not display their text messages in your chat history pane. Try left-clicking
  one of them in the <b>Avatar</b> list and see if one of the menu items is <b>UnIgnore</b>.
  If so, click <b>UnIgnore</b> to allow messages from that avatar to reach you.</p>
</blockquote>

<a name = "Q12"><h4>Someone is bothering me in one of the rooms. What can I do to ignore this person?</h4></a>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the <b>Avatar</b> list, left-click the avatar who is bothering you, then click <b>Ignore</b>.
  You will not see any text or gestures from this avatar in the chat history pane. You cannot
  prevent an avatar from moving toward you in
  the graphical window.</p>
</blockquote>

<a name = "Q13"><h4>VBScript error: This page is taking an unusually long time to finish</h4></a>

<blockquote>
  <p>You may see this error when loading the geometries and properties of certain virtual
  world environments. Do not click <b>Cancel</b>; if you wait a few more moments, the error
  message disappears and Virtual World loads.</p>
</blockquote>

<a name = "Q14"><h4>VBScript Error: Failed to Connect</h4></a>

<ul>
  <li>Check to see whether the server application is running. The Virtual Worlds server must
    always be running in order to connect to and change a Virtual World. If you are running a
    server locally, check the server's status display to see whether a connection has been
    made. </li>
  <li>Can other applications connect to the network, or to the computer running your server? </li>
  <li>If you are logging on with an existing avatar, are you using the right password? </li>
</ul>

<a name = "Q15"><h4>Other VBScript Errors</h4></a>

<ul>
  <li>Check your Internet Explorer safety level. You must set your Internet Explorer safety
    level to <i>Medium</i>, or several VBScript commands that are required for logging on will
	not be able to execute. </li>
</ul>
