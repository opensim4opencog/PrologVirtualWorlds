<h1>Looking Up Help</h1>

<p>
You can get help on almost any aspect of Virtual Worlds by using Virtual Worlds Help.
You can also use Virtual Worlds Help to find information on other components of Virtual
Worlds that you may have installed. </p>

<h2>First Steps</h2>

<h3>The Readme</h3>

<p>Before you start using Virtual Worlds, take a few minutes to check the Readme file for
last minute changes in the product. You can access the Readme file from your <strong>Start</strong>
menu by selecting <strong>Programs</strong>, then <strong>Virtual Worlds</strong>, then <strong>View
README</strong>.</p>

<h3>Contextual Help</h3>

<p>Online contextual help is available from any screen at the click of a button. You can
either click Help in the appropriate dialog box or screen in Virtual Worlds, or browse the
User Interface Reference section of the Table of Contents.</p>

<h3>Virtual Worlds Help</h3>

<p>You can try searching the documentation set for more help. The full documentation set
includes a search capability and index. </p>

<p>If you click <strong>Help</strong> on the Virtual Worlds toolbar, the Virtual Worlds
Help introduction page will be displayed, along with the table of contents. If you click
Help on a Virtual Worlds dialog box or window, a specific Help page will be displayed that
can guide you through that particular dialog box or window.</p>

<h4>Virtual Worlds Help Table of Contents</h4>

<ol>
  <li>On the Virtual Worlds toolbar, click <b>Help</b>.</li>
  <li>On the left side of the Help window, click the plus sign next to the folder that
    interests you. Several more folders will be displayed.</li>
  <li>Find the folder that contains the information you want, then click the plus sign next to
    that folder.</li>
  <li>If you can't find the information you want, follow one or both of the next two
    procedures.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Virtual Worlds Index</h4>

<p>The index usually will not find every instance of a word or phrase you give it, only
the more relevant ones. If you want to find every instance of a word or phrase in Help,
you might want to try the search engine instead. 

<ol>
  <li>Click the <b>Index </b>tab.</li>
  <li>Under <b>Type in the keyword to find</b>, type a word or phrase that describes what you
    want help with.</li>
  <li>If you see what you want help with in the list, double-click that topic. The topic for
    that item will be displayed in the window on the right.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Virtual Worlds Search Engine</h4>

<p>The search engine will find every instance in Help of any word or phrase you give it.
Because there may be many instances of a particular word or phrase, some of the pages the
search engine finds may not be relevant. If you are overwhelmed with the large number of
responses, you might want to try the index instead. 

<ol>
  <li>Click the <b>Search </b>tab.</li>
  <li>Under <b>Type in the keyword to find</b>, type a word or phrase that describes what you
    want help with, and then click List Topics.</li>
  <li>Under <b>Select topic to display</b>, double-click the topic you want.<br>
    The topic for that item will be displayed in the window on the right.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Virtual Worlds FAQ</h4>

<p>If these steps do not find the information you need, try the Virtual
Worlds Frequently Asked Questions page. With this information, you can troubleshoot
many common problems with Virtual Worlds.</p>

<h2>Help on the Web</h2>

<p>If for some reason you cannot find the assistance you need in Virtual Worlds Help, you
can go online for even more documentation and personal assistance.</p>

<h2>Learning with Virtual Worlds</h2>

<p>You can learn to program with the Virtual Worlds Tutorial. Simply launch the Create a
World Wizard and click on <strong>Tutorial</strong> when offered a list of worlds to
create. Once you have completed the Virtual Worlds Tutorial, you will be familiar not only
with Virtual Worlds, but also with such other advanced technologies as Visual Basic Script
and object-oriented programming.</p>

<p>The <em>Customizing Art and Content</em> section of the documentation will introduce
you to modeling three-dimensional graphics and creating DHTML content. </p>
