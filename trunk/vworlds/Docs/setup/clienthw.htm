<h1>Client Hardware and Software Requirements</h1>

<p>Applications built on the Microsoft Virtual Worlds platform consist of client and server 
components.  Both can run on the same machine, although this is not recommended for performance
reasons.  Multiple clients can run on the same machine.  Each world runs on a single server, and 
each server can host multiple worlds.
</p>

<p>
Hardware requirements do vary greatly with the type of application and number of concurrent users 
so utilize these as recommended starting points.

<h2>Hardware Requirements, Preferred</h2>

<p>Microsoft Virtual Worlds runs best with these preferred hardware requirements (or
greater): 

<ul>
  <li>A Pentium II-266MHz (or greater) CPU </li>
  <li>64 MB of RAM </li>
  <li>A 16-bit color, 1024 X 768 display on your monitor. </li>
  <li>Peripherals: Mouse, hardware accelerated video card, sound card. </li>
  <li>30 MB of free disk space for the Client-Only installation. </li>
  <li>10 MB of free disk space, minimum, for the Server-Only installation. </li>
  <li>60 MB of free disk space, minimum, for the Complete installation. </li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that 3D graphics performance on hardware accelerated video cards varies from manufacturer
to manufacturer.  Refer to the support newsgroup for more information about recommended cards and
chipsets.</p>

<h2>Hardware Requirements, Minimum</h2>

<p>Microsoft Virtual Worlds can run with these minimum hardware requirements: 

<ul>
  <li>A Pentium 200MHz (or greater) CPU </li>
  <li>32 MB of RAM </li>
  <li>A 256 color, 800 X 600 display on your monitor. </li>
  <li>Peripherals: Mouse. </li>
  <li>30 MB of free disk space for the Client-Only installation. </li>
  <li>10 MB of free disk space, minimum, for the Server-Only installation. </li>
  <li>60 MB of free disk space, minimum, for the Complete installation. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Minimum Supporting Software Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows 2000. </li>
  <li>Internet Explorer 5.0 (or greater) Full Installation (which installs Web Publishing Wizard, DirectX 6.1 (or greater)) -
    <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/">http://www.microsoft.com/ie/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All of these software prerequisites must be installed before installing Microsoft
Virtual Worlds. </p>
