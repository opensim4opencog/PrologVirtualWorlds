<h1>Installing Microsoft Virtual Worlds</h1>
<p>Applications built on the Microsoft Virtual Worlds platform consist of client and server 
components.  Both can run on the same machine, although this is not recommended for performance
reasons.  Multiple clients can run on the same machine.  Each world runs on a single server, and 
each server can host multiple worlds.
</p>
<p>There are two choices for installation options with Virtual Worlds: 

<ul>
  <li>Install the Virtual Worlds Server-Only (for running worlds on a Windows NT 4.0 network
    server computer). </li>
  <li>Install the Virtual Worlds SDK (everything), the authoring client and tools, 
    the basic sample client and other sample applications, and the server application. </li>
</ul>
<p>Note: We no longer supply a client-only installation as applications written using the Virtual 
Worlds platform will have their own custom clients.  We do supply a "basic client" sample 
as part of our SDK installation.</P>
<h2>Installing the Virtual Worlds Server-Only installation</h2>

<p>This installation only includes the essential components to run the Virtual Worlds Server and 
is for system administrators running NT4.0 servers which do not support 
the Virtual Worlds graphical clients (because appropriate versions of DirectX are not supported),
or for adminstrators trying to minimize disk footprints for server applications on other operating
systems (Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows 2000).</p>

<h2>Installing the Virtual Worlds SDK (complete)</h2>

<p>The Virtual Worlds SDK installation includes the authoring client and tools, the basic sample 
client and other sample applications, the server application, 
online help, and sample avatars. This installation also includes the Avatar Construction 
Kit, a tool that helps you customize your avatar graphics. </p>

<p>You can use this installation to create your own worlds, run a Virtual Worlds server, 
author your own objects and modify the world, and
socialize with others.</p>
