<h1>Virtual Worlds Server Hardware and Software Requirements</h1>

<p>Applications built on the Microsoft Virtual Worlds platform consist of client and server 
components.  Both can run on the same machine, although this is not recommended for performance
reasons.  Multiple clients can run on the same machine.  Each world runs on a single server, and 
each server can host multiple worlds.
</p>

<p>
Hardware requirements do vary greatly with the type of application and number of concurrent users 
so utilize these as recommended starting points.

<p>Content associated with worlds needs to be accessible by Virtual Worlds Client
applications either by a website or by a directory share (on an intranet). </p>

<h2>Hardware Requirements, Preferred</h2>

<p>Microsoft Virtual Worlds runs best with these preferred hardware requirements (or
greater): 

<ul>
  <li>A Pentium II-350MHz (or greater) CPU </li>
  <li>128 MB of RAM </li>
  <li>50 MB of free disk space (more may be needed as more worlds are hosted)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hardware Requirements, Minimum</h2>

<p>Microsoft Virtual Worlds can run with these minimum hardware requirements: 

<ul>
  <li>A Pentium 266MHz CPU </li>
  <li>64 MB of RAM </li>
  <li>10 MB of free disk space (more will be needed as worlds are hosted - we recommend 50 MB)
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Minimum Software Requirements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 (Service Pack 4), or Windows 2000. </li>
  <li>Microsoft Web Publishing Wizard, version 1.52 (or greater). </li>
  <li>ADS (Directory Services Software) - see the Virtual Worlds site, <a href="http://vworlds.research.microsoft.com/">
  http://vworlds.research.microsoft.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
To run the Server-Only installation (without running the graphical Virtual Worlds
client), the server can use Windows NT 4.0 (Service Pack 4). </p>
