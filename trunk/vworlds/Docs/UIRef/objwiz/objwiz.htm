<h2>Options</h2>

<h3>Artifact</h3>

<p>Click this option, then click the <strong>Create</strong> button to create an <strong>Artifact</strong>
object, a type of object used to represent ordinary objects in Virtual Worlds (usually the
sort that can be carried from one place to another). The <strong>Artifact</strong>
exemplar is the parent exemplar for <strong>WebPage</strong> and <strong>StateMachine</strong>,
as described below.</p>

<h3>Interworld Portal</h3>

<p>Click this option, then click the <b>Create</b> button to create an <strong>IWPortal</strong>
object, a type of portal that can transport avatars from one virtual world to another. (A <b>Room
Portal</b> is an object that can transport an avatar from one room in a world to another
in the same world, as described below.) </p>

<h3>Room Portal</h3>

<p>Click this option, then click the <strong>Create</strong> button to create a <strong>Room
Portal</strong> object, a type of object that can transport avatars from one room in a
virtual world to another room. </p>

<h3>State Machine</h3>

<p>Click this option, then click the <strong>Create</strong> button to create a <strong>StateMachine</strong>
object, a type of object that can be programmed to perform routine actions in a virtual
world. (Virtual Worlds <em>bots</em>, or objects that can interact with and sometimes give
the appearance of conversing with avatars, are usually state machines.) </p>

<h3>Web Page</h3>

<p>Click this option, then click the <b>Create</b> button to create a <strong>WebPage</strong>
object, a type of object that can be made to display an HTML page on the Internet or the
server when clicked.&nbsp; (The message to be displayed can also be simple text that
contains no HTML tags.)</p>

<p>Web page objects can be used for a variety of purposes, depending on the graphic that
represents the message in the world. They can be used to create notes, newspapers,
instructions, newbie information, links to external web pages, and so forth.</p>

<h3>Create</h3>

<p>Clicking this button finalizes your decision to create the type of object you have
chosen. It also displays a new dialog box in which you can edit the properties of the
object you are creating.</p>
