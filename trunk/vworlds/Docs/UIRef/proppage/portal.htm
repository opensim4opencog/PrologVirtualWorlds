<h1>Portal Property Page</h1>

<p>Portals are one-way doorways to other rooms; they transport avatars between the current
room and another room in the same world. You can specify the room to connect to and the
portal for returning to this room. You can also set the entry point for avatars to be
placed in the new room, and the direction in which the avatars will face on entering.</p>

<p>The default appearance of the portal object is an open door with a blue sky and desert
setting beyond the doorway.</p>

<h2>Property Page Options</h2>

<h3>Portal connect to</h3>

<h4>Room</h4>

<p>Choose the room in the world to which you want this portal to connect. You can choose <b>(Not
Set)</b> if you want to set the portal's destination room later; this is useful if you
have not built the destination room yet. </p>

<h4>Portal</h4>

<p>Choose the returning portal in the destination room that will help the avatars come
back to this spot. If a destination room does not have any portals in it, you must
teleport to that room and create some. Then select this portal again and re-set the
destination and the return portal. </p>

<h3>If an avatar enters the room through this portal</h3>

<h4>Entry point</h4>

<p>This is the entry point at which all avatars appear after passing through a portal. It
is a fixed location in the destination room. This is very useful if your room is designed
to focus on the view from a certain position. X, Y, and Z represent the coordinates of
this point. The X-axis runs left and right, the Y-axis runs up and down, and the Z-axis
runs into and out of the screen. </p>

<h4>Facing vector</h4>

<p>This is the direction you want the avatars to face when they arrive in the destination
room by going through the portal. Use this if your portal's entry point is near a wall or
pillar, and you want the avatars to see the whole room instead. If you set the three
components of this vector to (1, 0, 0), avatars entering the room face in the direction of
the positive X-axis. </p>

<h4>Scatter around entry point</h4>

<p>When many avatars travel through portals to the same entry point in a room, the avatars
tend to stack all into the same space. To prevent this, you can establish a scatter zone
around the entry point, so the avatars do not arrive at exactly the same spot. </p>

<p>A unit is equal to three feet. </p>
