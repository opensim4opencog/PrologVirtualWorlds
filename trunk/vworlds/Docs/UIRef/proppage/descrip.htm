<h1>General Property Page</h1>

<p>You can set the basic information about your object in this page. These are the first
things other avatars may notice about this object, such as the name and description, and
whether they can move the object or not. The name of the object's owner appears in the
lower right corner of the page.</p>

<h2>Property Page Options</h2>

<h3>Object Name</h3>

<p>Enter the name of the object. The name is shown in the room and avatar inventory lists
and also for object descriptions displayed to other avatars. </p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Enter the description of the object. This description is shown when other avatars click
<b>More About...</b> on this object. </p>

<h3>Is solid</h3>

<p>Select to make the object appear solid to avatars who collide with it. If this check
box is cleared, avatars are able to pass through the object. Objects are solid by default.
</p>

<h3>Is visible</h3>

<p>Select to make your object invisible in the world, but still have it appear in the room
inventory. This is useful for light or sound objects. Objects are visible by default. </p>

<h3>Can be taken</h3>

<p>When selected, your object can be taken by other avatars and stored in their inventory.
The default is that objects cannot be taken. </p>

<h3>Can be moved</h3>

<p>Select to make the object's position adjustable by the owner or a wizard. When this
check box is cleared, the object is &quot;anchored&quot; in place. This is especially
useful for pillars, walls, and permanent landscape or interior features. The default is
that objects can be moved. </p>

<h3>Is user interface accessible</h3>

<p>Select to make the object disappear from inventory lists, and to prevent any access
through the world view. The only way to modify objects that are not accessible in the user
interface is to use the <b>Object Explorer</b> and change the properties there. The
default is that objects are user interface accessible. </p>

<h3>Advanced</h3>

<p>Click this to go directly to the <b>Object Explorer</b> with this object selected. </p>
