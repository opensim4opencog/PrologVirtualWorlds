<h1>Texture Property Page</h1>

<p>A texture is a pattern or animated image that is applied to a section of an object. You
can apply textures to entire objects or the different sides of an object. The texture is
blended with the base color of the object. You can use your own texture files if they are
in a .GIF file format. </p>

<p><img src="texture.jpg" width="491" height="300" alt="texture.bmp (442854 bytes)"></p>

<h2>Property Page Options</h2>

<h3>Surface</h3>

<p>Choose the area to cover with the texture. You can cover the entire object (<b>All</b>)
or any of the sections listed. You can apply different textures to different sections of
an object. </p>

<h3>Material</h3>

<p>Begin choosing the texture to apply from the listed categories of materials. Included
are the default textures used in Microsoft Virtual Worlds for the pre-made environments.
The names of these categories start with an underscore (for example, <b>_gallery</b>.) </p>

<p>Once you have selected a category, select a specific texture. An image of the texture,
if available, is displayed in the preview window on the white base color. </p>

<h3>File Path</h3>

<p>As you choose a texture from the supplied files, the path to that file is listed here.
You can also list your own texture file, in a .GIF file format, in this box; if you do,
your texture appears in the preview window.</p>

<h3>Base Color</h3>

<p>Choose a base color for the selected object (or section of the object, if you picked a
particular side), and the texture you choose is blended with that base color in the
preview window. For example, if your chair object has a base color of white, and you add a
tan texture, you see a tan chair with the texture pattern. But if you add a colored
texture to a base color of yellow on the chair, the two colors will blend to make a new
color. Black combinations or base colors do not show textures. </p>

<p>Base colors are listed here in RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values, with 0 being the absence
of a color and 255 being the full intensity of a color. To set the base color to pure
white, enter the values (255, 255, 255).</p>

<h3>Advanced</h3>

<p>Click this to go directly to the <b>Object Explorer</b> with this object selected. </p>
