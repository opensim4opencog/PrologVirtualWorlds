<h1>Wizard Property Page</h1>

<p>This property page sets the permissions of the selected avatar. There are three levels
of permissions you can grant to another avatar, depending on the role of that avatar in
the world. </p>

<h2>Property Page Options</h2>

<h3>Is a Wizard</h3>

<p>Wizards can access all objects in this world, adding, modifying, moving, or deleting
any other objects. World owners are wizards by default. When a world is new, the world
owner is the only wizard, but they can designate other avatars to be wizards as well. </p>

<p>Wizards can be the designers of an area or the world, and they can help create the
world, finish the world, or maintain the world. Wizards see all the authoring tools. </p>

<p>Wizards also can not be logged off by host avatars. </p>

<h3>Is an Author</h3>

<p>Authors can create their own objects and modify, move, or delete those objects. They
cannot affect objects that are owned by anyone else. Authors see all the authoring tools.
Wizards can designate avatars to be authors. Authors cannot designate other avatars to be
authors; only wizard avatars can do that. </p>

<h3>Is a Host</h3>

<p>Hosts are the authority figures in the world. A host can log off another avatar (except
for wizards). This is most commonly done when that avatar breaks the rules of conduct set
for that world, that conversation, or that scenario. When a host logs off another avatar,
the log off message is displayed to all the avatars in that world. </p>

<h3>Advanced</h3>

<p>Click this to go directly to the <b>Object Explorer</b> with this object selected. </p>
