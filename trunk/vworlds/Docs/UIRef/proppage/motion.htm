<h1>Motion Property Page</h1>

<p>Objects can be set in motion, causing them to spin. You can set the speed of the spin,
and the axis to spin around. You can also cause the object to spin around axes other than
the three coordinate axes. By making objects rotate, you can produce many effects, such as
a globe revolving on its axis, bubbles rotating in water, or display items spinning in a
gallery. You can also add special effects by having objects that appear and disappear
through other objects. </p>

<h2>Property Page Options</h2>

<h3>Object spins</h3>

<p>Choose whether or not you want this object to spin. </p>

<h3>Spin Speed</h3>

<p>Enter the speed at which you want this object to spin. A positive number causes the
object to turn clockwise (assuming the object is rotating about its vertical axis, and is
viewed from above). A negative number causes the object to rotate in the opposite
direction. The number you enter here represents the number of radians the object rotates
in each rendered frame. (Note: there are 2 * Pi radians in one complete revolution.) If
you want the object to rotate once per second, and the clients are capable of rendering
twenty frames per second, then the object should spin one-twentieth of a revolution per
frame. This works out to 2 * Pi / 20, or approximately 0.3 radians per frame. If you
choose a very high spin speed, the computer may not be able to redraw the object quickly
enough. </p>

<h3>Spin on</h3>

<p>Choose the axis that you want the object to rotate around (this is optional). You can
choose the x, y, or z axis to spin around. Using the example of a character shaped like a
man, this is how each spin would work: 

<ul>
  <li>the x-axis spins the man in a cartwheel, with his front always facing you. </li>
  <li>the y-axis spins the man by pivoting his feet so that he turns like a top, clockwise,
    with his head always up. </li>
  <li>the z-axis spins the man head over feet, his arms always sticking out at his sides in
    the same place. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Custom</h3>

<p>If you want the object to spin around a particular vector, click this radio button and
type in the x-, y-, and z-coordinates of the vector around which you want the object to
rotate.</p>

<h3>Advanced</h3>

<p>Click this to go directly to the <b>Object Explorer</b> with this object. </p>
