<h1>Approach Property Page</h1>

<p>The approach distance is the amount of space between an avatar and an object when the
avatar does an <b>Approach</b> command on that object. This is useful to set for large
objects, tall objects, or wide objects, where the approaching avatar may get so close they
cannot tell what the object is. </p>

<h2>Property Page Options</h2>

<h3>Approach distance</h3>

<p>When an avatar approaches an object, the avatar stops at a specific distance from the
object. If your object is tall or wide, you may want to set a long distance, so the
approaching avatars can see the entire object. If the object is very small, on the other
hand, a short distance allows an avatar to move close and examine it.</p>

<p>The default approach distance is 4 units (each unit equals a meter). By default, two
avatars who approach an object simultaneously are placed slightly apart from each other,
the same distance from the object. </p>

<h3>Random scatter distance</h3>

<p>When avatars approach an object, they are stopped at the same distance each time. You
can set a random placement from this object to scatter the approaching avatars, so they
don't stack onto each other in the same spot. This is especially useful for portals,
preventing the initial stacking of avatars when they approach the exit. The default random
scatter distance is 1 unit (each unit equals a meter). If you click <strong>Approach to
the front of the object</strong>, all avatars approach the object in the same area in the
front, and you may experience crowding, but the random scatter distance may prevent
stacking of the avatars. </p>

<h3>Approach to the front of the object</h3>

<p>This is on by default, so that avatars approach the front of the object at the set
distance. You can turn it off so that avatars approach the object from all sides, but at
the same distance. </p>

<h3>Advanced</h3>

<p>Click this to go directly to the <b>Object Explorer</b> with this object selected. </p>
