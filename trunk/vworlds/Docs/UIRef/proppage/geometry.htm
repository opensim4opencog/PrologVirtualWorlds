<h1>Geometry Property Page</h1>

<p>On this page, you can specify the model of the object, point to a custom object file,
and pick the shading/rendering quality. Unless you pick a model, all objects appear as
their default shape, which&nbsp; is a light green pyramid for artifacts.</p>

<h2>Property Page Options</h2>

<h3>Models</h3>

<p>Choose the category of the model for your object. There are categories listed that
match the worlds and rooms provided with Microsoft Virtual Worlds, so you can choose from
those models as well. There are categories for basic shapes, outdoor and indoor items,
landscaping, landmarks, buildings, vehicles, weapons, characters and animals. The model
that you choose is usually rotated in the preview window after you select it.</p>

<h3>File path</h3>

<p>You can see the file paths to a default model here after you select it, or you can list
a file path to a custom model file of your own. If you type in a path, the model in that
file will appear in the preview window.</p>

<h3>Render as</h3>

<p>Render quality is the detail used to illustrate the model in the virtual world
environment, from wireframe to specially lit models. The higher the quality of the objects
for rendering, the slower the drawing of the objects and the room. Wireframe is the
fastest to draw, and Phong can be the slowest. The difference in the speed is from the
mathematical calculations used to shade the individual &quot;facets&quot; or polygons on
the outside of an object. </p>

<h4>Wireframe</h4>

<p>Displays the object in a wireframe outline, which displays the facets of the object.
This is useful for seeing through the object or for quick rendering. </p>

<h4>Solid (unlit)</h4>

<p>Displays the object without any shading or changes to the textures. A good setting to
use if you have a room without lighting. The model is rendered without any lighting
effects on the color. </p>

<h4>Solid (lit)</h4>

<p>Displays textures and material colors, darkening the colors of the sides of the object
that are in shadow. Shadows are caused by light objects in the room casting light on the
object. Objects placed in shadowed areas appear darker. If there is no lights in the room,
the object appears to be solid black. </p>

<h4>Gouraud</h4>

<p>Displays textures and material colors, darkening the colors of the sides of the object
that are in shadow. Gouraud is a mathematical method of calculating the shading of an
object. The facets are smoothed on the sides, blending the lighting effects as you move
around the object. If there is no lights in the room, the object appears to be solid
black. </p>

<h4>Phong</h4>

<p>Displays textures and material colors, darkening the colors of the sides of the object
that are in shadow. Phong is mathematical method of calculating the shading of an object.
The facets are smoothed on the sides, and the detail of the shading is very fine, blending
the lighting effects as you move around the object. If there is no lights in the room, the
object appears to be solid black. </p>
