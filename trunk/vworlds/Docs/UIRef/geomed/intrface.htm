<h1>Geometry Editor Interface</h1>

<p>The term &quot;geometry&quot; refers to aspects of the graphics that represent a
virtual object. You can use the Geometry Editor to change some properties of objects as
well as their position and orientation within the room.</p>

<p>You can reach the Geometry Editor from the Microsoft Virtual Worlds Client by clicking
the Geometry Editor tab at the bottom of the world view pane. If you do not have <a
href="../../users/others.htm">author status</a> within the world, however, the Geometry
Editor tab will not appear.</p>

<p><img src="toolbar.jpg" width="354" height="39" alt="toolbar.jpg (19441 bytes)"></p>

<h2>Geometry Editor 3D View</h2>

<p>Shows the current room and its objects, but not boundaries. You can use the navigation
tool to move around the room. This is the workspace for the Geometry Editor, and the place
where you can watch the changes that you make.</p>

<h2>Geometry Editor Menu Bar</h2>

<p>This appears beneath the normal blue Virtual Worlds Menu Bar. It contains icons for
tools and actions you can use within the Boundary Editor. Click an icon to select a tool
or action.</p>

<h3>Selected Object</h3>

<p>Shows the name of the object you are changing. You can type a name into the box, or
choose from a list of possible objects that appears when you click the down-arrow. If you
begin to type a name, Virtual Worlds tries to fill in the appropriate object name using
the letters you type. If you try to type a name that does not appear in the list, Virtual
Worlds supplies the closest match it can find; you cannot type in a new name.</p>

<p>Normally, when you select an object, a boundary box will be drawn around it, but
invisible objects (objects whose&nbsp; <a href="../../API%20Reference/Exemplars/Thing/IsVisible.htm"><strong>IsVisible</strong></a>
property is set to <strong>False</strong>) do not have boundary boxes drawn
automatically.</p>

<h3>Selection Lock</h3>

<p>Makes it impossible to use the mouse to select geometry. Locking the geometry keeps you
from selecting an object's geometry and changing it accidentally. This prevents accidents
by keeping you from moving any object other than the intended one, so that you are only
working with a single object at a time.</p>

<h3>Center View on Selected Object</h3>

<p>Moves the main view so that the current object is in the center. This makes it easier
to concentrate on one object at a time if you have several objects to edit. It can also
help you determine exactly which object corresponds to a name in the list.</p>

<h3>Delete Selected Objects</h3>

<p>Removes the current object or objects. An object must be selected, and you must not be
using the Navigate the Camera tool. After you click this button, a dialog will appear to
verify that you intend to delete the selected object.</p>

<h3>X, Y, and Z Text Boxes</h3>

<p>During Translate mode, these text boxes specify the position of the selected object in
the coordinates of the world. During Rotate mode, these text boxes specify the rotation
around each axis. During Scale mode, these text boxes specify the scale of the selected
object on each axis.</p>

<h3>Navigate the Camera Tool</h3>

<p>Changes your mouse pointer to the navigation tool. When you are using this tool, you
can move your camera viewpoint around the room, but you cannot select or change objects in
it. You can use this tool to move quickly through the room and to see an overview of the
objects and their positions.</p>

<h3>Translate Object Tool</h3>

<p>Changes your mouse pointer to the Translate Object tool, and puts the Geometry Editor
into Translate mode. This is the tool you can use to change the position of objects: you
can select an object by clicking it in the main view, and then you can move the object by
dragging.</p>

<p>If gravity is off, you can use the shortcut of right-clicking an object in Translate
mode to move it up or down.</p>

<h3>Rotate Object Tool</h3>

<p>Changes your mouse pointer to the Rotate Object tool, and puts the Geometry Editor into
Rotate mode. Using this tool, you can select a particular object (by clicking it) and then
rotate it as you like, by dragging it in the direction you want. The object will stay in
the same place while it rotates.</p>

<h3>Scale Object Tool</h3>

<p>Changes your mouse pointer to the Scale Object tool, and puts the Geometry Editor into
Scale mode. With this tool, you can select an object (by clicking it), then drag it to
resize it and rotate it, keeping the object's basic shape intact. This can be useful if
you create an object that is out of scale with your room.</p>

<h3>Zoom In Tool</h3>

<p>Changes your mouse pointer to the Zoom In tool. When you are using this tool, you can
click on the main view to produce a larger image of the current room. You can enlarge the
graphics to make working on small objects easier. Be careful not to confuse this tool with
the Zoom Out tool, which looks very similar.</p>

<h3>Zoom Out Tool</h3>

<p>Changes your mouse pointer to the Zoom Out tool. When you are using this tool, you can
click on the main view to produce a smaller image of the current room. This is useful when
you wish to see an overview of the room, the objects, and their boundaries. Be careful not
to confuse this tool with the Zoom In tool, which looks very similar.</p>

<h3>Zoom Level</h3>

<p>Shows the proportion between the actual size of the world graphics and the current
view. You can type a proportion into the box, or choose from a list of possible views that
appears when you click the down-arrow. If you begin to type a proportion, Virtual Worlds
tries to fill in the appropriate view using the numerals you type. If you try to type a
proportion that does not appear in the list, Virtual Worlds supplies the closest match it
can find; you cannot type in a new proportion.</p>

<h3>Perspective View</h3>

<p>Switches the main view to show the room and objects as an avatar in the world would see
them. This is essential, so that you can monitor the way your changes register inside the
virtual world. Toggles with Top View, so that clicking either will switch between the two
viewpoints.</p>

<h3>Top View</h3>

<p>Switches the main view to show the room and objects from above. This can be very useful
in positioning objects well within the virtual world. Toggles with Avatar View, so that
clicking either will switch between the two viewpoints.</p>

<h3>Toggle Gravity </h3>

<p>Turns gravity on or off in the world. The appearance of the button shows whether
gravity is on or off. <font SIZE="2">If gravity is on, then after an object is moved, it
falls until it hits something solid (usually a floor). Further, when gravity is on,
avatars cannot fly (CTRL+UP), and can walk down stairs and fall from ledges. If gravity is
off, however, objects and avatars do not fall (or walk down stairs), and avatars can fly.</font></p>

<h3>Camera Follows Object</h3>

<p>Specifies whether the camera moves to follow an object that the translate tool has
moved off-screen.</p>

<h3>X, Y, and Z Buttons</h3>

<p>The X, Y, and Z buttons are axis locks. If you depress one or more of these buttons,
you will be prevented from transforming the object on the axes that you lock. For example,
if you are looking at an object and choose not to move it left or right, then depress the
X button and the object will not be able to move left or right. </p>

<p>You can also constrain axes with the X,Y,and Z keys on the keyboard, in a way that is
logically opposite of the X, Y, and Z buttons on the toolbar. If you press the X key, you
can then <em>only</em> move the object on the X axis. In this way, pressing the X key is
equivalent to locking both the Y and Z axes with the Y and Z buttons on the toolbar.</p>

<p>The axis locks (X, Y, and Z toolbar buttons) and axis constraints (X, Y, and Z keys)
use the view coordinate system, which is the coordinate system of the camera. The X, Y,
and Z text boxes work in the coordinate system of the virtual world itself. This means
that when you lock an axis, you may still see changes in the text box for that axis.</p>
