<h1>Room Wizard, Step 2 of 2</h1>

<p>You can create a new room with the Room Wizard and add it to your world. You might want
to do this if your world receives a lot of visitors who need more space to explore, for
example, or you might want to create a private test room where you can experiment with new
objects and scripts before adding them to the public rooms of your world.</p>

<p>With this step of the Room Wizard, you can pick the type and style of room you want to
create. </p>

<h3>Rooms</h3>

online.&nbsp; </p>
