<h1>Room Wizard, Step 1 of 2</h1>

<p>You can create a new room with the Room Wizard and add it to your world. You might want
to do this if your world receives a lot of visitors who need more space to explore, for
example, or you might want to create a private test room where you can experiment with new
objects and scripts before adding them to the public rooms of your world.</p>

<p>With this step of the Room Wizard, you can name and describe your room, and
automatically link it to the world you are in. You can also choose to teleport to the new
room when it is finished.</p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<h3>Room Name</h3>

<p>Type the name of the new room into this text box. This is the name people see in the
Room Contents tab of their client windows.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Enter a brief description of the new room in this text box. This description will pop
up when people click the room name in the Room Contents tab of their client windows, and
gives them some information to help them decide whether to enter the room.</p>

<h3>Create a portal to the new room from...</h3>

<p>Click this check box if you want the new room to be immediately accessible from the
current room. A two-way portal is created that all visitors will be able to use
immediately. If you select this option, you can add access permissions for the portal
later.</p>

<h3>Teleport to the new room when the wizard is finished</h3>

<p>Click this check box if you want to visit the new room immediately after it is created.
If you do not select this option, you can still move into the new room after it is
created, using a portal (if one exists) or by teleporting.</p>
