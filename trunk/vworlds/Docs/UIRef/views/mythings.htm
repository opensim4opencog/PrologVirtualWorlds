<p>If you click an object's name, a <a href="../cliels/shortmen.htm">shortcut menu</a>
appears for that object, as depicted above. With the shortcut menu, you can get
information about the objects your avatar is carrying; you can also drop them, view and
edit their properties, and perform various actions upon them (for example, you can display
a <strong>Web Page</strong> object by selecting <strong>Show...</strong> from its shortcut
menu).</p>
