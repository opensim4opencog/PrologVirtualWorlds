<h1>Avatars Tab</h1>

<p>This tab in the Virtual Worlds client window presents a menu that helps you to get
information about the avatars in the world with you, as well as interact with them in
various ways. It also displays the status of the avatars (whether a particular avatar is
on your Friends or Ignored lists, and whether it belongs to you).</p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<h3>Avatar Name Highlighting</h3>

<p>The name of every avatar in the room is listed in the tab next to a thumbnail graphic
of the avatar. (A gavel will appear instead of a thumbnail for avatars who are Hosts.) 

<ul>
  <li><strong>Blue: </strong>If an avatar's name is highlighted in blue, it means the avatar
    is the one you are currently using.</li>
  <li><strong>Green: </strong>If an avatar's name is highlighted in green, it means the avatar
    has been added to your Friends list.</li>
  <li><strong>Gray Italic: </strong>If an avatar's name is listed in gray italic letters, it
    means you are currently ignoring that avatar.</li>
  <li><strong>Black: </strong>If an avatar's name is listed in plain black, that means it
    falls into none of the other categories.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Avatar Shortcut Menu</h3>

<p>If you click on an avatar's name, an <a href="../cliels/avashort.htm">avatar shortcut
menu</a> will drop down for that avatar, as depicted above. The shortcut menu allows you
to get information about the avatars in the world with you, as well as whisper to them,
ignore them, add them to your Friends list, approach them, and view various properties of
those avatars. </p>
