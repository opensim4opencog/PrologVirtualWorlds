<h1>Authoring Tools Tab</h1>

<p>This tab of the Virtual Worlds client contains options that will transport you
instantly to another room, allow you to add an object or a room to the world, or to
perform advanced scripting-related tasks like entering VBScript commands or modifying
methods and properties of objects in the world.</p>
