<h1>Avatar Construction Kit Interface </h1>

<p>You can create custom avatars, gestures, and thumbnails in the Avatar Construction Kit.
After opening your .GIF file with the avatar images, you can drag and drop the images to
place them in the Crop Tool or the Gesture Frames, or in the Thumbnail. You can play your
gesture to see what it would look like in Microsoft Virtual Worlds. </p>

<p><img src="ack.jpg" width="414" height="319" alt="ack.jpg (118149 bytes)"></p>

<h2>Image Construction Area</h2>

<h3>Image Library</h3>

<p>Displays the images from a file that you import, usually a .SPR file. A typical .SPR
file contains 24 images in it. You can find default avatar images in the directory</p>

<pre>   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Virtual Worlds\Local Content\Avatar Graphics\</pre>

<h3>Crop Tool</h3>

<p>You can drag images into this Crop Tool and zoom in or out of the image with the slider
control. For instance, to zoom in on a figure's face for a thumbnail, drop the image here
and adjust the sliders until only the head and shoulders are framed by the Crop Tool. Then
drag this image to the Thumbnail box, the Gesture Frames, or the Image Library. </p>

<h2>Avatar Construction Area</h2>

<p>In Microsoft Virtual Worlds, avatars are equipped with thumbnail images, gestures, and
their idle image. The thumbnail image is placed next to the avatar's name in the People
pane of the Virtual Worlds interface. The gestures are displayed when you choose them in
the virtual world. The idle image is the first and last frame of every gesture and the one
frame seen the most in the virtual world. </p>

<h3>Gesture Frames</h3>

<p>This is where you can assemble your own sequence of images to make a gesture. First
select a gesture to customize from the gesture buttons. Second, drag the images you want
from the Image Library, Crop Tool, or the Thumbnail and place them in any of the frames. </p>

<p>The frames in the Gesture Frames area are lettered. This represents the order that the
frames are played for that particular gesture. There is a letter for each frame in that
gesture. Some gestures are longer than others. </p>

<p>Note: The first frame of the idle gesture is played before and after every other
gesture in Microsoft Virtual Worlds. </p>

<h3>Gesture Preview</h3>

<p>Displays the selected gesture from the Gesture Frames area. You can test the gestures
to see how they would look in the virtual world. </p>

<h3>Thumbnail</h3>

<p>The thumbnail picture is displayed next to the name of the avatar in the People pane of
the Virtual Worlds interface to represent you when you are online and in that room.
Usually the thumbnail is a smaller and less-detailed picture of the most recognizable
features of the avatar, such as a face on the human figures. You can drag images from the
Image Library, Crop Tool, or Gesture Frames to use here. </p>

<h2>Publish to Web Server</h2>

<p>This <strong>File</strong> menu option displays the <strong>Web Publishing Wizard</strong>,
with which you can copy your avatars to a server. If the Web Publishing Wizard is not
present on your computer, then this option displays an error dialog box.</p>
