<h3>Main Pane</h3>

<p>This pane displays the commands you enter into the text entry pane below it, as well as
the results of those commands. See the illustration above for some examples.</p>

<h3>Text Entry Pane</h3>

<p>Enter the commands you want Virtual Worlds to execute into this text box. The commands
you type are executed immediately, with the following exception: if you type the first
line of a Visual Basic Script subroutine (the line containing the keyword <em>Sub</em>),
all subsequent lines are interpreted as part of this subroutine until you enter the line
containing <em>End Sub</em>.&nbsp;Similarly, you 
can enter a multi-line subroutine or function into the command window by 
entering all of the code for the subroutine on one line, with each statement 
separated from the next by a colon (:).&nbsp; After such a subroutine or 
function has been entered into the command window, it can be called by name at any time during
the same command window session.</p>
