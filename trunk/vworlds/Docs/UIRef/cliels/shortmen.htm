<h1>Client Shortcut Menus</h1>

<p>Client shortcut menus contain actions you can use on objects to change them or get
information on them. If you right-click an object, a menu appears, and you can drag to
select an option.</p>

<h2>Client Shortcut Menu Options</h2>

<p>You can only click objects that are in the same room as your avatar.</p>

<h3>More about...</h3>

<p>Displays the current description of the object.</p>

<h3>Go Through</h3>

<p>Moves your avatar through the portal. If the portal is a <strong>Room Portal</strong>,
you will be taken to another room in the same world. If the portal is an <strong>Interworld
Portal</strong>, you will be transported to another virtual world. (This menu item is only
available on <strong>Room Portal</strong> and <strong>Interworld Portal</strong> objects.)</p>

<h3>Show...</h3>

<p>Displays the text and graphics of a web page. (This menu item is only available on <strong>Web
Page</strong> objects.)</p>

<h3>Take</h3>

<p>Adds the object to your avatar's inventory. (This menu item is only available on
certain objects. If you own an object and want to make it takeable, use the <strong>Properties...</strong>
menu item.)</p>

<h3>Approach -&gt;&gt;</h3>

<p>Selecting this option makes your avatar approach the selected object. This will usually
bring your avatar facing the front of the selected object, although it may bring you to a
slightly different position, depending on the object's settings.</p>

<h3>Properties...</h3>

<p>Displays the <a href="../proppage/descrip.htm">property pages</a> for the object, with
which you can set certain attributes of the object. (This menu item is only available on
objects you own, unless you are a Wizard.)</p>
