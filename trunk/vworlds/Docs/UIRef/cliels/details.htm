<h3>LastRemoteSpriteURL</h3>

<p>This Profile key tracks and allows users to utilize avatar graphics located on remote file shares and 
web servers.  In the past, there was no convenient way for users to utilize avatar graphics
that weren't already installed into their <install directory>/Local Content/Avatar Graphics local directory.
