<h1>Avatar Shortcut Menus</h1>

<p>Avatar shortcut menus contain actions you can use on an avatar to change it or get
information on it. If you right-click an avatar, one of two menus appears, depending on
whether you click your own avatar or another avatar. When the menu appears, you can drag
to select an option.</p>

<h2>Avatar Shortcut Menu Options for Your Avatar</h2>

<p>You must be using a <a href="../../users/camera/cameras.htm">camera angle</a> that
includes your avatar in the main view to be able to click your own avatar.</p>

<h3>Avatar's Profile</h3>

<p>Your avatar's profile appears when you select this option. When it does, you can change
your <a href="appear.htm">appearance</a>, check your <a href="friends.htm">Friends list</a>,
or&nbsp; use any other options contained in the profile. This option appears with your
avatar's nickname instead of the word &quot;avatar&quot;; for example, if your avatar's
nickname is Joe, the option appears on the menu as <em>Joe's Profile</em>.</p>

<h3>Whisper...</h3>

<p>Selecting this option makes the <a href="whisper.htm">Whisper</a> window appear. When
it does, you can select other avatars and whisper to them. The Whisper window stays on top
of the main view until you close it. </p>

<h2>Avatar Shortcut Menu Options for Other Avatars</h2>

<p>This menu appears when you click another avatar. You can only click avatars that are in
the same room as your avatar.</p>

<h3>Avatar's Profile</h3>

<p>The selected avatar's profile appears when you use this option. When it does, you can
look at parts of that avatar's profile, to see more information about the user. This
option appears with the selected avatar's nickname instead of the word &quot;avatar&quot;;
for example, if that avatar's nickname is Joe, the option appears on the menu as <em>Joe's
Profile</em>.</p>

<h3>Whisper To</h3>

<p>Selecting this option makes the <a href="whisper.htm">Whisper</a> window appear. When
it does, the selected avatar will already appear in the &quot;Whisper To&quot; box, and
you can select other avatars to add to the list. The Whisper window stays on top of the
main view until you close it. </p>

<h3>Ignore</h3>

<p>Selecting this option makes your avatar <a href="ignoring.htm">ignore</a> the selected
avatar. Ignoring an avatar causes it to appear to be inside a bottle, and prevents that
avatar from talking to you again. The ignored avatar's nickname also appears in your
avatar's Ignored list (within the Profile). If you right-click the ignored avatar, an
option to remove the Ignore status appears.</p>

<h3>Add to Friends List</h3>

<p>Selecting this option sends the selected avatar a request to join your <a
href="friends.htm">Friends list</a>; if the avatar accepts, it is added to your Friends
list automatically. This gives that avatar certain abilities, like being able to see
information in your file that is limited to those on&nbsp;your Friends list.</p>

<h3>Approach -&gt;&gt;</h3>

<p>Selecting this option makes your avatar approach the selected avatar. This will usually
bring your avatar face-to-face with the selected avatar, although it may bring you to a
slightly different position, depending on the other avatar's settings.</p>
