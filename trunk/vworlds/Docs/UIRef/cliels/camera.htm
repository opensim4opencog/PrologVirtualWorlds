<h1>Camera Views Dialog Box</h1>

<p>With this dialog box, you can change the vantage point from which you see your
surroundings, including whether you see your own avatar and what parts of it you can see.</p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<h3>Through my eyes</h3>

<p>Click this radio button to choose a &quot;first-person,&quot; &quot;headless&quot; view
of the virtual world. As it is when you are standing and facing forward in real life, you
will not be able to see your avatar's head and body; instead, the graphical window will be
entirely filled by your field of vision. Use this option if you are comfortable with
first-person camera views, which can sometimes be disorienting.</p>

<p>This camera view is the default.</p>

<h3>Facing me</h3>

<p>Click this radio button to choose a camera view of the virtual world that includes the
front of your avatar, as if someone were filming while walking backward in front of you.
Some people find it difficult to navigate a virtual world using this camera view. It is
perhaps best used for short periods of time, or with specific tasks in mind, such as
getting a detailed idea of how your avatar appears to others.</p>

<h3>Over my shoulder</h3>

<p>Click this radio button to choose a camera view of the virtual world that includes your
avatar's head and shoulders. This is the next-easiest camera view with which to navigate,
after the <strong>Through my eyes</strong> view. Some people prefer it because it gives
them a feeling of presence in the virtual world, especially if they have not used a
&quot;first-person&quot; view before.</p>

<h3>Attached to</h3>

<p>Click this radio button to attach the camera view to any object in the world that has
this capability, if any are available. If no objects in the room can accept camera
attachment, none will appear in the list window. You see the world as if you were sitting
on whatever object you attach it to. Attaching the view to a rotating object is good for
seeing many parts of a room continuously, and can have a certain
&quot;merry-go-round&quot; novelty value as well.</p>
