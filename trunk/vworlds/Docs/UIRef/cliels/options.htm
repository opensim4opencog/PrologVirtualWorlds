<h1>Options Dialog Box</h1>

<p>You can change your performance settings for Virtual Worlds in this dialog box.</p>

<p><img src="options.jpg" width="412" height="334" alt="options.bmp (412878 bytes)"></p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<h3>Audio</h3>

<h4>Play sound effects</h4>

<p>Turns the music and other sounds on or off. You might want to turn sound off if you are
in an environment where it would disturb others, or if you find it distracting.</p>

<h3>Text History Display</h3>

<h4>Show gestures</h4>

<p>Displays avatar gestures in the text history window. For instance, when this box is
selected, you see a line of text saying <strong>Paul smiles</strong> in the text history
window when Paul's avatar performs a smile gesture, if you are in the same room.</p>

<h4>Show events</h4>

<p>An event is an internal signal that Virtual Worlds sends to itself to trigger certain
behaviors. This option displays Virtual Worlds events in the text history window, and is
primarily of interest to scripters.</p>

<h4>Show system messages</h4>

<p>Displays Virtual Worlds system messages (for example, errors)&nbsp; in the text history
window as they occur. This option is primarily of interest to scripters, since the
messages are irrelevant to everyday use of the Virtual Worlds client.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<h4>Auto download new avatar graphics</h4>

<p>Specifies whether new avatar sprite files are downloaded automatically. The Virtual
Worlds interface can automatically get avatar graphics that are not on your computer, or
display a thumbnail image until you double-click to load the avatar image to your
computer. </p>

<p>The Virtual Worlds client stores graphics for avatars on your computer, but retrieves
them first from the server for the world you are in. Once your computer has an avatar's
graphics, they won't need to be downloaded again unless they have changed.</p>

<h4>Turn off hardware acceleration</h4>

<p>Disables your hardware graphics card so that the rendering (drawing) of Virtual Worlds
can go faster. Virtual Worlds supports hardware acceleration using certain video cards. If
your card supports hardware acceleration, turn this option off. If you are uncertain, ask
the manufacturer of the card whether this is supported.</p>

<h4>Force Back Buffering</h4>

<p>Toggles the use of the back buffer when you are using hardware acceleration.  Various display problems can be resolved by toggling
the use of the back buffer.  If you see flickering sprites or can't select objects with the mouse in the rendering window, try toggling this setting.
</p>

<h4>Switch to lower resolution when moving</h4>

<p>Simplifies the graphics of the world while your avatar is moving around, to draw the
world faster, and simulate movement more smoothly. The world will be drawn with
low-resolution graphics until your avatar stops moving.</p>

<h4>Best graphics quality</h4>

<p>Displays graphics as smoothly and with as much detail as possible. If this is selected,
graphics are slower, but of higher quality. This option cannot be selected at the same
time as the <strong>Best performance</strong> option. </p>

<p>Select this option if you are performing graphical work within the world as a Wizard or
Author, such as modeling, adding boundaries, and so on. The world will then be displayed
as accurately as it can be, making precision work easier.</p>

<h4>Best performance</h4>

<p>Displays graphics as fast as possible in the virtual world. If this is selected,
graphics are faster, but of lower quality or resolution. This option cannot be selected at
the same time as the <strong>Best graphics quality</strong> option. </p>

<p>Select this option if system response speed is an issue, if the room you are in is
crowded, or if you have a slow net connection, for example.</p>
