<h1>Directory Server Address Dialog Box (Virtual Worlds Server)</h1>

<p>Use this dialog box to set the URL (Universal Resource Locator) for the location of the
<b>Directory Services</b> server. The <b>Directory Services</b> server, a computer running Microsoft
Site Server<font size="2">©</font>, lists all of the worlds that have been published to
it. The Virtual Worlds Server application enables you to publish your world to the
<b>Directory Services</b> server by using ADSI, the Active Directory Services Interface. This
interface uses the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, or LDAP, to enable client users
to publish their worlds to the <b>Directory Services</b> server. Once your world is published to
the <b>Directory Services</b> server, users in one virtual world can elect to visit another
merely by clicking its name in the list of worlds that the <a href="../cliels/dirserv.htm"><b>Directory</b>
dialog box</a> displays. </p>

<p>To use this protocol, you need to enter two pieces of information: 

<ul>
  <li>The computer name for the <b>Directory Services</b> server</li>
  <li>The name of the <b>Directory Services</b> directory</li>
</ul>

<p>For the example in the accompanying figure, the computer name is <em>carlh2</em>, and
the <b>Directory Services</b> directory is <em>carlhvworld</em>. The last item, <em>dynamic</em>,
indicates that any listing created by the <b>Directory Services</b> server will be stored
dynamically (in memory), rather than on the client's hard disk.</p>

<h2>To use the <b>Directory Server Address</b> dialog box:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Type the name of the machine that is hosting the <b>Directory Services</b> server, and the name
    of the directory. The syntax for this line is <b>LDAP://</b>&lt;computer
    name&gt;<b>/o=</b>&lt;directory&gt;<b>/ou=dynamic </b><blockquote>
      <p>For example: </p>
      <pre>LDAP://DSServer/o=DSList/ou=dynamic</pre>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Click <b>Set</b>.</li>
  <li>Check the first line of the <b>Statistics</b> pane in the Virtual Worlds
    Server application to see if your world is connected to the <b>Directory Services</b> server. If
    your world successfully connects, the status message reads, &quot;Connected to
    DS&quot;. If not, the status message reads, &quot;Not connected to DS&quot;.</li>
</ol>
