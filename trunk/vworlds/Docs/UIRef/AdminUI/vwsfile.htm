<h1>File Menu (Virtual Worlds Server)</h1>

<p>The <strong>File</strong> menu of the Virtual Worlds Server
application handles operations that involve opening an existing
world, creating a world, saving a world, renaming a world, and
removing a world. You can save a world as a checkpoint file or
export a world as a Microsoft Visual Basic Script© script file.</p>

<h2>File Menu Options</h2>

<h3>New World... </h3>

<p>Launches the <a href="../../uiref/worldwiz/wwiz1.htm"><strong>Create a World Wizard</strong></a> so that
you can create a new world. While the Virtual Worlds Server has
no set limit on the number of worlds it can host at the same
time, server response may be slower if there are more than 20
avatars in one room of a particular world or more than 100 in all rooms of
all worlds.</p>

<h3>Open... </h3>

<p>Opens a Virtual World that has been previously saved as a
checkpoint file, which is a Virtual Worlds binary file format used to
store all of the world's information. The file name extension for
checkpoint files is .VWC.   Use <b>Import...</b> to open a world that
has been stored in a script file.</p>

<p><strong>Important Note</strong>: the checkpoint file stores
version information about the Virtual Worlds software that
created it. A checkpoint file created by an earlier version of
Virtual Worlds <em>cannot</em> be opened by a later version.</p>

<h3>Save </h3>

<p>Saves your currently selected world as a checkpoint file
(ending in .VWC), to the <tt>~\Microsoft Virtual Worlds\Worlds</tt>
directory. The Virtual Worlds Server application also
creates a backup of your world as part of the world-saving
process.  The checkpoint file format is not guaranteed to be
valid for different versions of Virtual Worlds.  If you save
your world (using <b>Save</b> or <b>Save As...</b>) with one version of
Virtual Worlds, you must use the same version to open the world.  If
you plan to upgrade Virtual Worlds software, <b>Export</b> your world
to a script file, and then Import it when you have completed the
software upgrade.  This menu choice is active only when a world window is
selected.</p>

<h3>Save As... </h3>

<p>Saves your currently selected world as a checkpoint file
(ending in .VWC) with a filename you choose, to the <tt>~\Microsoft Virtual Worlds\Worlds</tt>
directory.  This command also creates a new backup file (ending in .BAK.VWC) for the world,
using the new name. All activity is switched to the
world with the new name you specify: the registry is changed to
point to the freshly named checkpoint file, and any avatars in
the world are sent a warning message, asking whether they want to
switch to the newly-named world. This menu choice is active only
when a world window is selected. </p>

<h3>Delete<strong> </strong></h3>

<p>Deletes the selected world from the server by deleting the
world's checkpoint file and registry key. This menu choice is
active only when a world window is selected.</p>

<h3>Import... </h3>

<p>Imports a world by loading a Microsoft Visual Basic Script©
script file into the <a href="../../uiref/adminui/import.htm"><b>Import Script Wizard</b></a>. The
script file must have been saved previously with either the <strong>Export</strong>
or <strong>Export As...</strong> menu options. You can <strong>Import...</strong>
a script file saved by an earlier version of Virtual Worlds into
a current version. The same is not true for checkpoint files;
before Virtual Worlds opens a checkpoint file, it determines
whether or not the checkpoint file version is the same as that of
the Virtual Worlds software. Checkpoint files created by earlier
versions of Virtual Worlds will not be opened. </p>

<h3>Export </h3>

<p>Saves the world as a Microsoft Visual Basic Script© script
file (with a .VBS suffix) to the <tt>~\Microsoft Virtual Worlds\Worlds</tt>
directory. This option (and the <strong>Export As...</strong> option) provides
compatibility between different versions of Virtual Worlds
software. If you save the world as a script file using one
version of Virtual Worlds, you can load the world (by using the <strong>Import...</strong>
menu option) with another version. The same is not true for
checkpoint files. This menu choice is active only when a world
window is selected.</p>

<h3>Export As... </h3>

<p>Saves the world as a Microsoft Visual Basic Script© script
file (with a .VBS suffix) to the <tt>~\Microsoft Virtual Worlds\Worlds</tt>
directory, using the filename entered by the user. This option (and the <strong>Export</strong>
option) provides compatibly between different versions of Virtual
Worlds software. If you save the world as a script file using one
version of Virtual Worlds, you can load the world (by using the <strong>Import...</strong>
menu option) with another version. The same is not true for
checkpoint files. This menu choice is active only when a world
window is selected.</p>

<h3>Exit </h3>

<p>Closes the server after taking all worlds offline. </p>
