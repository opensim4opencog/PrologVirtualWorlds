<h1>Tools Menu (Virtual Worlds Server)</h1>

<p>The <b>Tools</b> menu of the Virtual Worlds Server application contains 
operations that set properties on the world such as its Directory Service listing and
server security. 
</p>

<h2>Tools Menu Options</h2>

<h3>Directory Server Address&#133; </h3>

<p>Opens the <b>Directory Server Address</b> dialog box, where you can set the
location of your Directory Services server, a server that displays a
list of all Virtual Worlds that have been published to it.   Users can log on
to any world listed on the Directory Services server just by clicking the world's name.</p>
<p>The <b>Directory Server Address</b> must be a fully qualified URL (Uniform
Resource Locator).</p>

<h3>Clear Performance Averages</h3>

<p>This resets the statistics displayed in the Server Log's bottom status window.
</p>

<h3>User Authentication&#133;</h3>

<p><b>Note</b>:&nbsp;Only available when using Microsoft NT. Opens the <b>User Authentication</b> 
dialog box, where you can turn on NTLM Authentication and specify a local group to further restrict
access to a server within an authenticated domain.
</p>
<p>
For a client connecting to a server who hasn't been authenticated against the domain that the 
server machine belongs to, a username/password dialog box will be presented on the client machine.  Most
users within an intranet, will have been authenticated upon logging into their machine.  
<p>
Local groups are groups greated on the local domain of the server.  If this option is activated, only
users who are members of the specified local group can access worlds on the server.

<h3>Set Max User Limit&#133;</h3>

<p><b>Note</b>:&nbsp;Only available when using Microsoft NT. Sets the maximum number of users for 
the server. The minimum valid number is 1.
<p>

<h3>Show World in Directory Services </h3>

<p>Displays the world's name in the Directory Services.  Note that even if your world is not
listed on the Directory Server, people can still log on to the world, as long as they
know its URL (Uniform Resource Locator).     </p>

<h3>Take World Offline </h3>

<p>Disconnects all avatars from the selected world, and closes it. Use this option when
you want to make repairs to the world or other authoring changes.  You can also use this option
if you want to limit access to your world to certain hours of the day, or certain days of the week. </p>

<h3>Web Address... </h3>

<p>Opens the <b>Web Address </b>dialog box, where you can set the URL (Uniform
Resource Locator) for a web page that contains information about your world. This is used 
by the Directory Services page.</p>
