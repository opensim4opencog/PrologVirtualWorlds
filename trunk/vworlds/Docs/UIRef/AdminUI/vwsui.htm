<h1>Virtual Worlds Server Application</h1>

<p>The Microsoft Virtual Worlds Server application runs one or more
Virtual Worlds on a server computer. Until the server is running and the
administrator has opened a world, no one can enter that world.</p>
<p>The Virtual Worlds Server application also contains tools that help an administrator
manage the worlds on the server and basic server maintenance tasks.  You can create new worlds, open worlds that have been created,
save a world, delete a saved world, and monitor events in worlds that are active at a particular
time.  You can also take a world offline to repair or change it, list a world in the Virtual Worlds
Directory Service, set user authentication features, and link a world listing to a related World Wide Web page.</p>

<p>The Virtual Worlds Server application interface consists of a menu bar, a <b>Server Log and Statistics</b>
window, and one <b>World</b> window for each Virtual world that has been loaded.  (A world may be loaded at
the server's startup, or while the server is already running.) </p>

<h2>Server Log and Statistics Window</h2>
<p>The <b>Server Log and Statistics Window</b> is divided into two panes.
The upper pane is the <b>Server Log Pane</b>, which displays system messages.
The lower pane is the <b>Statistics Pane</b>, which displays network communication information.

<h3>Server Log Pane Options</h3>

<h4>Date/Time</h4>

<p>You can check here for the exact time and date that a server event occurred. </p>

<h4>Message</h4>

<p>The messages displayed in this column include error messages and notification that the
server is ready to receive users. </p>

<h3>Statistics Pane</h3>

<h4>Directory Service Information </h4>

<p>This line indicates whether the server is connected to the Directory Server. If the
world is listed in the Directory Server, people can select it from the Directory
and be transported to that world.</p>

<h4>Number of open worlds </h4>

<p>This section contains information about the number of open worlds, their names, the
number of avatars connected for each, and an indication of message flow from the server to
each world. (The server is IDLE if no messages are sent; otherwise, details of the message
are displayed.)</p>

<h4>Client Connections </h4>

<p>This section displays the total number of users connected to all open worlds that are
currently hosted by the server. This information is important to the Server administrator
because, in general, as the number of users increases, so does the system response time.
Strictly speaking, however, it is the number of messages
sent between the server and connected clients that is the principal factor in
performance. A small number of avatars moving around and talking causes more
client-server communication than a large number of avatars who are not as active.</p>

<h4>Queue statistics </h4>

<p>Server messages are placed in a <em>priority queue</em>, a list in which
messages with higher priority are processed before messages with lower priority, and those that
have the same priority are processed in the order they were received.  The
queue statistics that are displayed include the status of the current message, the total number
of messages in the queue, the total number of messages received from all clients, and the total
number of messages that have been processed.  If there are many unprocessed requests in
the queue, performance will suffer on the Virtual World clients.</p>

<h4>Communication details </h4>

<p>This section provides information about the quantity of data sent and received by the
server. </p>

<h2>The World Window</h2>

<p>The title bar of this window displays the name of the world, whether it is accessible
to external clients (public) or not (private), and the number of users. </p>

<h3>World Window Options</h3>

<h4>Date/Time</h4>

<p>You can check here for the exact time and date that a world event occurred. </p>

<h4>Messages</h4>

<p>The messages displayed include notification that the world is ready to receive users,
that the world is loaded into memory, and that users have entered or left the world. Error
messages are also displayed in this window.</p>
