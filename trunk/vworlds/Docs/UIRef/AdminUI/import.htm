<h1>Import Script Wizard</h1>

<p>You can export a virtual world into a Microsoft Visual Basic Script<font size="2">©</font>
file. By exporting the world, you can reconstruct the world and all the objects in it by
importing the file. </p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<h3>Enter your world name and server location</h3>

<h4>World name</h4>

<p>Enter the &quot;friendly&quot; name for the world here. This can match the name the
world had before, if you are restoring a virtual world. This is the name that is displayed
in the <a href="../cliels/dirserv.htm"><b>Directory</b> dialog box</a> whenever
people choose a world to visit, and the &quot;Show World in Directory Services&quot;
option is turned on for your world on the server. The name can be up to 255 characters
long. </p>

<h4>World description</h4>

<p>You can type a short description of your new world into this text box, so that people
can decide whether they want to visit the world. The description is optional. </p>

<h4>Server</h4>

<p>Type the location of the Virtual Worlds server you plan to use into this text box. If
the server you plan to use is the computer on which you are currently creating the new
world, type <em>localhost</em>.</p>

<h3>Setup your world administrator logon</h3>

<h4>Administrator name</h4>

<p>Type the name you want to use for the administrative avatar of your new world into this
text box.</p>

<h4>Password</h4>

<p>Type the password for your administrative avatar into this text box.</p>

<h4>Confirm Password</h4>

<p>Re-type your new password into this text box. We recommend you make your password easy
to remember, so that you never lock yourself out of your world. </p>

<h3>Enter the name of the exported database to import</h3>

<h4>Script filename</h4>

<p>Enter the name of the exported world file here, with the pathname (if necessary). You
can use Browse to find the file in another directory. Export files are Visual Basic files,
and have a .VBS extension. </p>

<h3>Import</h3>

<p>Click to import the Visual Basic database file of the virtual world. The Script Events
window shows the progress and status of the file. </p>
