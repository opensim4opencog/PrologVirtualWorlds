<h1>Property List Editor Dialog Box</h1>

list</strong></a>, and to change their names or the values they contain.</p>

  <li>To edit the value of a property in the property list, double click the value listed for
    the property, or right-click the property and select <strong>Edit Value</strong> from the

    dialog box.</li>

    Property</strong> from the menu that appears, or just select the property and click the <strong>Remove</strong>
