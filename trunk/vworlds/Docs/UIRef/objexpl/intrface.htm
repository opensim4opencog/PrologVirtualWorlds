<h1>Object Explorer Interface</h1>

<p>In the Object Explorer window, you can add, modify, and delete properties and methods
on any object for which you have write access. (If you are a <a
href="../../users/others.htm">Wizard</a>, you have write access for every object in the
world.)</p>

<h2>Object Explorer Options</h2>

<h3>Objects Pane</h3>

<p>The <b>Objects Pane</b> lists World properties and methods, modules (if any) that have been added to the world,
and the room containing the user.</p>

<h4>World</h4>

<p>Select <b>World</b> to view properties and methods of the world.  This icon has no right-click menu.</p>

<h4>Modules</h4>
<p>Any modules that have been added to the world are listed beneath <b>Modules</b>.  If you want to add a module
to the world, select <b>Modules</b>, right-click, and then click <b>New module...</b>.  This action opens
the <a href="newmodu.htm">New Module Dialog Box</a>.</p>
<p>After a module has been added to the world, there are two additional right-click menu items that become available
when you select it: <b>Reload Module</b>, and <b>Delete Module</b>.  Use <b>Reload Module</b> if you have made
changes to the code of the module and you want to make these changes available to your world.  Use <b>Delete Module</b>
if you have no further use for that module. </p>

<h4>The User's Room</h4>

pane to select it for editing. The object's properties and
