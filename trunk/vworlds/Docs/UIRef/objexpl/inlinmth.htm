<h1>Inline Method Editor</h1>

<p>In the <b>Inline Method</b> <strong>Editor</strong> dialog box, you can write or edit
the code for an inline method whose code is confined to a single sub or function.</p>

<p><img src="inlinmth.gif" width="513" height="400"></p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<h3>Object</h3>

<p>This text displays the name of the object whose method you are adding or editing.</p>

<h3>Inline Method</h3>

<p>You can select one of the inline methods available in the world here. This menu lists
all of the inline methods currently in the world. </p>

<h3>Edit Name</h3>

<p>Click this button to enter a new name for the method you are adding or editing.</p>

<h3>New Method</h3>

<p>Click this button to create a new inline method on the object being edited. (The name
of this object appears under the <strong>Object</strong> heading of this window.) The new
method is visible in the <strong>Methods</strong> pane of the <a href="intrface.htm"><strong>Object
Explorer</strong></a>.</p>

<h3>Load Script</h3>

<p>Click this button to load a script file from your hard disk. This makes it easy to edit
a script in your favorite text editor, then load the script into Virtual Worlds.</p>

<h3>Save to Script</h3>

<p>Click this button to save the script displayed in the main pane of this dialog to a
text file. After the script is saved, you can print the script, export it to another
virtual world, or edit it in another application and load it back into Virtual Worlds with
the <strong>Load Script</strong> button.</p>

<h3>Delete</h3>

<p>Click this button to completely delete the method you are editing from the virtual
world, and optionally delete the menu items associated with it. After clicking this
button, the method name is no longer displayed in the <strong>Methods</strong> pane of the
<strong>Object Explorer</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>Caution! </strong>After you delete a method from your virtual world, any
methods or properties that call it will fail with an error.</p>

<h3>Add Menu Item</h3>

<p>Click this button to create a new menu item that calls the method you are editing. (The
<a href="newmenu.htm"><strong>New Menu Item</strong> dialog box</a> is displayed.)</p>

<h3>Execute on</h3>

<p>A menu appears when you click here; tell Virtual Worlds whether your method should be
run on the client, on the server, or both by selecting a value from this menu. 

<ul>
  <li>If you select <strong>Client</strong>, then if the method is invoked from a client, it
    will be run only on that client, but if the method is invoked from the server, it will be
    run remotely on all bystander clients. </li>
  <li>If you select <strong>Server</strong>, then if the method is invoked from a client, it
    will be run remotely on the server, but if the method is invoked from the server, it will
    be run only on the same server. </li>
  <li>If you select <strong>Client and Server</strong>, then if the method is invoked from a
    client, it will be invoked both on that client and on the server, but if the method is
    invoked from the server, it will be run remotely both on all bystander clients and also on
    the server. </li>
</ul>
