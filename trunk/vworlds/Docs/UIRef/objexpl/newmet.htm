<h1>New Method Dialog Box (Object Explorer)</h1>

<p>Use this dialog box to add a new method to the current object in the Object Explorer. </p>

<p><img src="newmet.jpg" width="260" height="171" alt="newmet.bmp (133434 bytes)"></p>

<p>Add a new method to an object if you would like it to exhibit special behavior that
Virtual Worlds does not provide. For example, you can program an object to be a <em>bot</em>,
an object that behaves like a robot avatar under the computer's control, and can give help
to users or participate in limited conversation. </p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<h3>Object</h3>

<p>This text displays the object to which the new method will be added, which is always
the object currently selected in the Object Explorer.</p>

<h3>Method Name</h3>

<p>Enter the name of your new method here. Try to use a name suggestive of what the method
actually does. For example, if you are adding a method that will make your avatar float
into the air, name your method something like<em> Float</em> or <em>Fly</em>, not <em>JoesMethod</em>
or <em>Method22</em>.</p>

<h3>Module</h3>

<p>Select the module that contains the code for your method from this drop-down menu. If
you have added a module to the world, it will be listed in this menu; otherwise this menu
will have only a single entry, <strong>Inline Module</strong>.</p>

<h3>Subroutine</h3>

<p>If you have added a module to the world, enter the name of the subroutine (or function)
in that module. If you have not added a module to the world, this option is grayed out.</p>

<h3>Execute on</h3>

<p>Tell Virtual Worlds whether your method should be run on the client, on the server, or
both, by selecting a value from this drop-down menu. 

<ul>
  <li>If you select <strong>Client</strong>, and if the method is invoked from a client, it
    runs only on that client, but if the method is invoked from the server, it runs remotely
    on all bystander clients. </li>
  <li>If you select <strong>Server</strong>, and if the method is invoked from a client, it
    runs remotely on the server, but if the method is invoked from the server, it runs only on
    the same server. </li>
  <li>If you select <strong>Client and Server</strong>, and if the method is invoked from a
    client, it is invoked both on that client and on the server, but if the method is invoked
    from the server, it runs remotely both on all bystander clients and also on the server.</li>
</ul>
