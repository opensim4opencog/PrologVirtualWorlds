<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The How-To section is a collection of documents that provide hints and suggestions on successfully creating Virtual Worlds. Each topic addresses different suggestions on such subjects as designing an online community, working with 3-D graphics, and programming suggestions based on the experiences of other users. For a specific discussion of Virtual Worlds programming conventions and a discussion of the object model, see the <a href="../../Programmer's%20Guide/Virtual%20Worlds%20Programmers%20Guide%20Start%20Page.htm">Programmer's Guide</a>.
