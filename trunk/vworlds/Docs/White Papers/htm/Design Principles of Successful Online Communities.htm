<p class=Body>This study is directed toward Microsofts project to create
online graphical virtual communities. In this report we provide a general
discussion of the challenges that will have to be met in the online community
and suggest a set of design principles to guide the construction of the
community. These design principles derive from a large body of research which
has attempted to identify the distinguishing characteristics of successful,
self-regulating communities. We enumerate the key challenges and offer design
recommendations.</p>

<p class=Body>We report here on a set of effective means of cultivating social
solidarity and community in online interactive environments. These design
principles derive from a large body of research which has attempted to identify
the distinguishing characteristics of successful, self-regulating communities.
Online communities share a great deal with communities built around more
traditional face-to-face communication, but we highlight places where online
environments offer special opportunities for or challenges to the formation of
robust social relationships.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc459786898">Promoting Community</a></h2>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786899">Why is community important?</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>It is worth asking at the start what
communities are and why they should be a guiding consideration for the
development of a computer network application. The term <i>community</i> is ambiguous. It is used to describe groups that range
from neighbors to nations and levels of solidarity from the personal to the
professional. Community has recently become a fashionable term. Its popularity
symbolizes a growing sense of social isolation and a growing concern for safety
and civility. But community is neither a simple nor uniformly positive thing.
Nostalgia may tinge our memories, but community has always been a conflictual
and frustrating process. But as face-to-face community has frayed, computer
networks have increasingly looked like a new resource for its revitalization.
The spontaneous formation and robust development of thousands of online groups
and self-proclaimed communities <i>is </i>a
unique and powerful phenomenon.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786900">What defines a community?</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>A community is more than a group of
co-present people. Generically, a community can be understood as a group of
people connected by ongoing social relations and bound together by a common
interest or shared circumstance. For us, the key feature that sets communities
apart from other forms of social organizations is the presence of a <i>commons</i>.
A commons is a form of social organization that allows open access to a
collectively produced or managed resource (see <a href="#_The_Possibility_of">The
Possibility of Cooperation</a>, later in this introduction). We define a
successful community as a self-sustaining collective organization that produces
resources for its own maintenance and for other groups use.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786901">Why should community guide the design of the
network?</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Community is essential to the
development of commercial online network systems because it is the only way to
convert commodified cyberspace into specialized <i>cyberplace</i>. To do this, one must create something that <i>cannot</i> be easily reproduced and
transferred elsewhere. The roots of community bind it to its place in the same
way that a vine is bound to a trellis.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Community does more than merely anchor
a group of people to a certain system. Communities are the best form of social
organization to encourage members to create their own content. Therefore,
commerce should be grown out of community, rather than trying to establish a
community within a virtual shopping mall. Communities create a form of content
that goes beyond the standard offerings of online services.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786902">What are the challenges to the creation of
community?</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Although they are useful and robust,
the formation and maintenance of a community faces significant challenges. Our
perspective is that the tensions inherent in all community cannot be resolved
exclusively through technical means. Powerful tools must be connected and
coordinated within a social framework. Social systems must be dealt with as
organisms that must be cultivated and grown, not designed and built. The key
challenge is to cultivate cooperation by balancing the tension between
individual and collective interests.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc459786903"></a><a name="_The_Possibility_of"></a>The Possibility of Cooperation</h2>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786904">Individual versus Collective Rationality</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>At the root of the problem of
cooperation is the fact that there is often a tension between individual and
collective rationality (Kollock and Smith 1995). This is to say that in many
situations, behavior that is reasonable and justifiable for the individual
leads to a poorer outcome for all. Such situations are termed <i>social dilemmas</i> and underlie many of the
most serious social problems we face. One of the most famous models of social
dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons (Hardin 1968). Hardin described a
group of herders having open access to a common parcel of land on which they
could let their cows graze. It is in each herders interest to put as many cows
as possible onto the land, even if the commons is damaged as a result. The
herder receives all the benefits from the additional cows and the damage to the
commons is shared by the entire group. Yet if all herders make this
individually reasonable decision, the commons is destroyed and all will suffer.
</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>A related model of the tension between
individual and collective rationality is the challenge of providing public
goods. A public good is a resource from which all may benefit, regardless of
whether they have helped create the good (for example, public television or a
community improvement project). The temptation is to enjoy a public good
without contributing to its production, but if all reach this decision, the
good is never created and all suffer.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>The tragedy of the commons and the
challenge of providing public goods share a common feature: At the heart of
each of these models in the free-rider problem. Whenever one person cannot be
excluded from the benefits that others provide, each person is motivated not to
contribute to the joint effort, but to free-ride on the efforts of others. If
all participants choose to free-ride, the collective benefit will not be produced.
The temptation to free-ride, however, may dominate the decision process and
thus all will end up where no one wanted to be (Ostrom 1990, 6).</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>The tension between individual and
collective interests is at the heart of the challenges that must be met if an
online community is to be successful. In the next two sections, we discuss the
most important social dilemmas that exist in online communities and offer a set
of recommendations for solving these dilemmas.</p>

<h1 style='margin-left:0in'><a name="_Toc459786905">Key Challenges to be Faced
in the Community</a></h1>

<p class=Body>In this section, we offer a description and analysis of the key
challenges that will be faced in the online community. In particular, we
examine the following tasks that must be accomplished in a successful
community:</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Establish norms and rules of decorum.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc459786906">Encourage Active Contributions to the Community</a></h2>

<p class=Body>Encouraging the users of
this system to create content is the central challenge. Microsoft will not be
able to create all the content needed for the world, nor will third party
providers be able to fill the remaining gap. The users must be able to extend,
create, and manipulate the world. This requires a well-designed set of tools that
allows new members to immediately begin modifying the world, while providing
advanced members with sophisticated tools for building more complicated
objects.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786907">Contributions to the community</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>While Microsoft may provide many of the
broad outlines of the virtual world, there are many things that the users
themselves must provide.These
contributions take two basic forms: contributions to the objects in the world
and contributions to the social fabric that holds together the groups that
produce and utilize those objects.It
is important to recognize that the former depends upon the latter.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Users will be relied upon to construct
a range of objects, spaces, and activities.In order for the environment to be compelling, the creation of
new aspects to the world must be an ongoing processthe world will never be
complete.But all forms of
creation in a social context are subject to the constraints of social dilemmas.Free riding, over-consumption and
under-production plague all social groups.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786908">The case for self-governance</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>It is tempting to rely upon a central
authority to enforce and promote social order and continued contributions.However, central authorities have
many limitations.Centralized
governance is expensive and often inefficient.Further, some aspects of social cohesion <i>cannot </i>be externally provided.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>It is far better, then, to encourage
groups to provide their own means of regulating their members and ensuring that
there is sufficient contribution to the continued maintenance and extension of
the virtual world.The dilemma
comes from the fact that some of these essential contributions are not
attractive, and require that groups encourage members to provide these
services.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786909">Obstacles to contributions</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>There are two key obstacles to the
provision of essential contributions to the community.First, there is the issue of motivation: Members must have incentives to contribute to the collective
good.There is always the
temptation to free ride on others contributions.Second, there is the issue of skill: Contributions will be minimized if they are too difficult or
complex to create.The skill
needed to create and modify the world must ramp up, allowing unsophisticated
users to begin immediately, while allowing sophisticated users to increasingly
push the envelope.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Whether a result of problems of
motivation or skill, there are a number of classic ways in which groups fail.A group can be said to have failed
when members do not contribute sufficiently to collective resources, overuse
the resources that are available, become disorganized, or cannot regulate
themselves.This can occur at
any point along the life cycle of a group, so that a group can fail to take
off, fail to sustain itself, or die from a crisis it cannot overcome.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>In some cases, obstacles within the system
can actually be a positive resource for community construction.For example, sophisticated use of
the system is a valuable resource: It
creates a scarce good (skillfully created objects, for example), encourages
trade and exchange, and offers an example for others to follow.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc459786910">Manage Bandwidth and Other Common Resources</a></h2>

<p class=Body>Any community will have a number of finite common resources that
need to be managed if the community is to be successful.These include technical resources (the carrying capacity of the
connection, system resources, and display space) and social resources (limits
on the demands that can be made on others time, attention, and knowledge).These common resources are
especially vulnerable to depletion when there are sudden increases in the
population of the community.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786911">Scarcity of common resources</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>What are the common resources that must
be managed in an online community?Despite
the fact that virtual spaces are in many ways limitless, there are a number of
finite resources that are open to common use. Scarcity intensifies the tension
between individual rationality (which urges each person to use as much of a
resource as they can) and collective rationality (which demands that resources
be replenished and consumed at a sustainable rate).</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>In virtual spaces, there are two major
categories of scarce resources: technical resources and social resources.Technical resources like bandwidth
and displayspace are
important considerations for this system.The former is a problem of all online forms of interaction.The latter is a special limitation
of graphical virtual worlds.The
carrying capacity of a graphical space is more limited than in a textual one
where only spoken/acted events take up any room.This limitation impliesthat certain spaces will become crowded and require that systems be
created to ensure equitable distribution.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Perhaps more fundamental than the
technical limitations are the forms of social scarcity.The most scarce social resource in the virtual world is the
attention of other members.Others
competence, knowledge, time, interest, and validation are resources that no
software package can provide and are the core attraction of any online system
devoted to social interaction.Finding
ways to encourage members to make these resources available while ensuring that
members do not abuse, over-consume, or intentionally destroy these resources is
the primary goal of social design.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>To cultivate this balance, it may be
necessary to limit a range of aspects of the virtual world, including but not
limited to the population and its rate of growth, the amount of interaction,
and the extent to which members can build new objects.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>An example of an attempt to regulate
some of these aspects in an online community can be found in a variety of text-based
virtual worlds, including LambdaMOO and MediaMOO.In these communities, explosive population growth taxed the
communitys capacity for socialization of new members and frequently swamped
the bandwidth and servers response capacity, creating huge lag times for all
(a classic commons dilemma).In
addition, rapid and uncoordinated construction of new objects and spaces made
the communities confused and overburdened.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>The communities responded in a number
of ways.LambdaMOO, for
example, instituted a population growth policy, limiting the rate of new
arrivals to allow the community to absorb and socialize new members.MediaMOO attempted to limit
population growth and to ensure an appropriate background for new members by
requiring that applicants demonstrate an academic interest in new media
research.Both MOOs instituted
panels of members who had authority to review publicly accessible new
construction to ensure overall coherence and economy.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>America Onlines (AOL) rapid increase
in membership illustrates the problems associated with a sudden population
growth.Technical resources
were frequently exhausted, and social norms that were crafted among the
original users were swamped and disrupted.While all communities need to grow, growth beyond technical and
social capacities can seriously damage a community.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Common resources are often nested
within one another.The larger
commons created by an online service may have a number of smaller common
resources within it, each with distinct qualities and needs.For example, AOL maintains a range
of chat rooms which allow synchronous exchange of lines of text between a group
of members visiting the same room.When
an individual orsmall group of
members fills the room with a continuous stream of text (often meaningless
gibberish or obscenities) this small common resource is destroyed.No other conversation can easily
co-exist in this environment.This
has become a fairly common problem in AOL.Their response has been to officially prohibit this behavior
and to have employees police chat rooms, warning and then banning offending
users.While this approach has
had some success, it requires that a significant number of AOL employees devote
much of their time to policing.We
suggest that a more effective response is to ensure that members are able to
resolve this problem on their own or in small groups (see <a
href="#_Allow_Members_to">Allow Members to Govern Their Own Behavior</a> and <a
href="#_Encourage_Members_to">Encourage Members to Enforce Their Own Rules</a>,
later in this paper).</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc459786912">Coordinate Activities and Interests</a></h2>

<p class=Body>Successful community relations require more than the motivation
to work collectively.Individuals
must be able to find other like-minded members, coordinate their activities in
time and space, and stay focused on their collective tasks.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786913">Coordination</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>A common assumption is that a kind of
social gravity is sufficient to attract like-minded and interested people
together.This is often not the
case.Cooperation requires more
than the motivation to work collectively.Individuals must be able to find others with whom to work
collaboratively.Essentially,
there are three basic issues: how do people find each other?, how do people
identify other members of the same groups?, and how do people stay focused on
their collective task?</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Failure to resolve these issues results
in a range of problems.Without
sufficient coordination, activities get carried out in the wrong place. This
leads those looking to participate in them to fail to be able to contribute, or
results in redundancy, which often exacerbates resource consumption.When activities are not clearly
coordinated, groups are frequently interrupted and distracted by members who
mistake them for another group or area.As a result, the social space is filled with overlapping and conflicting
activities.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>These issues imply three related forms
of coordination:interests,
time, and space.It is
necessary to facilitate the process of finding and identifying like-minded
people.Further, the demands of
a synchronous graphical space add the need to coordinate meetings in time,
suggesting the need for regular daily and weekly schedules of activities.Resources must be available to aid
groups in getting the word out about their existence, upcoming meetings, and
the availability of new and existing resources.Finally, the organization of space is a crucial element,
especially in a graphical system.The
organization of spaces in relationship to one another may require that some
form of zoning or architectural review panel be instituted to prevent a
topological hodgepodge (see <a href="#_Create_Clear_Boundaries">Create Clear
Boundaries</a>, later in this paper).</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>One solution is often referred to as
the creation of <i>Schelling points</i>
(Schelling 1960), prominent features of the environment that provide for
implicit coordination.For
example, travelers in New York City often look for each other under the clock
in Grand Central Station.While
Schelling points inevitably arise in any community, they can also be intentionally
created or supported.Interest
groups may, for example, employ iconic architecture, building objects that
resemble their interests as a way to advertise their presence (for example, a
building shaped like a town hall or a cat or a doughnut).</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc459786914">Establish Norms and Rules of Decorum</a></h2>

<p class=Body>Communities need to reproduce themselves, to create and transmit
their rules, norms, expectations and understandings to new members, and to
reinforce them in existing members.Every
community must maintain a body of knowledge, contain people who are willing to
be teachers, people who are willing to learn, and people willing to enforce the
norms and punish transgressions.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786915">Socialization</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>All groups create a set of expectations
about the behavior of members and nonmembers.However, a well-thought-out set of norms and expectations has
little value if new members have no way to learn them.There must be a variety of resources to facilitate the learning
of the local culture of a group.One
common method is to rely on existing members to instruct newcomers.This <i>is</i> an effective method, but it can be easily overwhelmed if
existing members find that all of their time in the group is spent teaching an
endless stream of newcomers.A
form of commons failure is possible in these situations in which the older
members withdraw from the group (retreating to what has been referred to as the
virtual suburbs), leaving the new group members to fend for themselves
without the benefit of the existing groups culture and experience.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Creating a record of past debates and
discussions that can be easily accessed by newcomers is an effective supplement
to direct teaching.However,
institutional memory may pose a special challenge in a graphical synchronous
environment if no means of recording interaction is available.An example of an effective
application of institutional memory can be found in the WELL, where almost all
interactions are stored, sometimes for very long periods of time, allowing new
members to return to old debates and discussions.This reduces the amount of time older members must spend
socializing new members (or allows them to accomplish this by simply pointing
them to the appropriate area).It
also allows any newcomer to study the entire history of the group.Norms and rules will also vary from
group to group and from one space to another.Thus, there is an additional issue of ensuring that boundaries
are clearly marked so that members of the community recognize when they are
passing into and out of different cultures (see <a
href="#_Create_Clear_Boundaries">Create Clear Boundaries</a>, later in this
paper). </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>The existence and widespread
recognition of expectations and norms is a necessary but not sufficient element
of a successful community.Even
well-socialized members may violate these expectations.A successful group must be able to monitor and enforce the
rules of their community.(see
<a href="#_Encourage_Members_to">Encourage Members to Enforce Their Own Rules</a>,
later in this paper)</p>

<h1 style='margin-left:0in'><a name="_Toc459786916">Design Recommendations</a></h1>

<p class=Body>In this section, we offer a specific set of recommendations to
meet the challenges enumerated above.In
particular, we will discuss the following design principles:</p>

</span></span>Create an internal economy.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc459786917"></a><a name="_Promote_Ongoing_Interaction"></a>Promote Ongoing Interaction</h2>

<p class=Body>Strangers have every reason to exploit one another.It is only when one is likely to
meet a person again that it becomes sensible to act cooperatively.People must cross each others paths
regularly for community to emerge.The
community should be designed to encourage initial interactions between members,
promote recurrent interactions, and encourage group activities.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in'><i>Mutual cooperation can be stable if
the future is sufficiently important relative to the present.</i> - Robert
Axelrod, 1984, p. 126.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in'>-Japanese Proverb: You can do whatever
you want once youre out of your hometown.</p>

<p class=Body>Social contactinteracting with other members of the systemis
the basic resource of community.But
transitory contacts are not enough.To
generate a robust and cooperative community, individuals must come into contact
with one another a number of times and expect to see one another and be seen
regularly over time.Many
valuable resources can only be produced collectively.The system can cultivate cooperation by incorporating
activities and functions that require cooperative activity into the design of
the world.</p>

<h3> <a name="_Toc459786918">First
steps - Encourage initial interactions</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>For any community to emerge, the first
step is to ensure that people come to the system and stay long enough for
social connections to form.While
this may in large part be the task of marketing, some design decisions can
encourage the process.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Because presence on the system in real
time is one of the essential ingredients of social solidarity, we recommend
that the pricing model not be based on time.In fact, long periods of time connected to the system might be
rewarded.Any disincentives to
remaining on the system reduces the availability of members to cultivate
connections.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Simple presence online is only the most
basic prerequisite.Cultivating
bonds of familiarity, obligation, and reciprocity takes more than co-presence.Indeed, this process is multifaceted
and not easily formalized.Different
people follow different paths to social connection.Therefore, we suggest that the system be designed to allow for
and even encourage varying levels of participation.Interaction with other individuals and groups should allow for
a gentle scaling of action with low entry costs.This means that lurking must be formally supported.There should be ways of subtly
signaling overtures and acceptances as well as varying levels of group
membership and affiliation, distance, and opposition.These processes are dealt with in face-to-face communication
through body language, tone of voice, and subtle differences in markings,
clothing, and insignia. It is the initial steps in group formation that must be
most strongly supported.This
means that tentative connection must be made easy and comfortable.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Priming the system with active,
interesting members is a powerful way to catalyze this process (Goodwin 1994).Members who visibly welcome and
announce new members, introduce members to one another, and can offer support
and reassurance are essential.These
hosts or virtual cruise directors can act as community leaders, helping the
group to focus its activities and manage its conflicts.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786919">Crossing paths - Promote recurrent interactions</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>After entering the system, members
should be able to come into casual contact with one another.If the cost of contact is high,
members will only interact when they are sure they want to create a
relationship.Because many
flourishing relationships happen in surprising places, the system must create
the conditions that encourage casual contact.The simplest model for this is to create the equivalent of
pedestrian spaces that cause members that are in route to other parts of the
system to cross one anothers paths.Bonds
may not be formed in such public spaces, but the raw materials of such
relationships (recognition, familiarity, and some notions of identity) are.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Such spaces for casual contact may
require that one of the basic aspects of virtual spaces be intentionally
limited.Most virtual spaces
allow for instantaneous relocation from one point in the space to any other.Such teleportation is often seen as
a way to improve and simplify the use of such systems.We suggest that teleportation be offered only in limited and
restricted forms.Because ease
of transport may still be desirable, we suggest that differential costs be
associated with various forms of transportation that are inversely proportional
to the social quality of the journey (see <a href="#_Create_an_Internal">Create
an Internal Economy</a>, later in this paper).</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Small groups can sustain themselves in
ways that large groups cannot.Capitalizing
on this small group effect is another way the system can encourage the
emergence of community.Small
groups can communicate and coordinate ideas and activities far easier than
large ones. To capture this effect for the system, we suggest that the space be
subdivided into small areas.Each
area should provide a homefor each
user along with a central common area providing transportation services and
information.Homes may be
places for storing objects or settings that provide privacy and intimacy, along
with a showcase of personal identity.But
like interaction in general, homes should have a range of spaces that run the
spectrum between private and public.Porches,
for example, allow people to be at home while accessible to passersby and
neighbors.Similarly, the
social physics of the system can make certain activities easier to accomplish
(or available at all) when a certain number of people are co-present.Crowded rooms may have capacities
that do not exist in sparsely populated rooms.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>These architectural choices increase
the density of by-the-way information about the world and its citizens.Many of these design considerations
rely on the availability and maintenance of at least one rigid framework of
spatial connection.If people
are to be required to walk along streets so that they come into casual contact
with one another, a single unified space must exist.This need not preclude the connection of other multidimensional
spaces, but it does mean that users and system designers restrict themselves to
some spatial regularity in a primary frame of reference.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786920">Work together - Encourage group activities</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>After they are brought together,
members should be encouraged to work together.There are a number of ways to accomplish this, most simply by
creating a range of activities that <i>cannot
</i>be accomplished alone.For
example, building simple structures may be possible working alone, but more
complex buildings and objects may require two or more members to coordinate
their construction.Moving
large building elements, for example, may require multiple members.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>We are therefore recommending that the
system be designed so that otherwise solitary activity be restructured as
social activity.Further,
already social activities, such as games and conversations, should also be
supported.Integrating
text-based conferencing tools is one way to accomplish this, but may pose
special challenges for a graphical system.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Working together may also mean engaging
in conflict with one another.Social
friction, even when it springs into flame, can be an important element of social
cohesion.It seems to be widely
recognized that users will engage in conflict with each other with little or no
help.However, successfully
overcoming a challenge to an <i>entire</i>
community is a powerful source of group solidarity (Sherif et al. 1961).Although these crises do have
dangerous potential, it may be worthwhile for the system designers to create or
cultivate challenges that require whole groups to mobilize.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc459786921">Encourage the Creation of Reputations</a></h2>

<p class=Body>Cooperative relations require that members be identifiable to
each other so that reputations might form.Reputations serve as both an incentive for cooperative behavior
and a disincentive for selfish behavior.Bodies and identities should be distinctive and there should be a
multitude of ways of displaying interests and intentions.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in'><i>The ability to recognize the other
[person] from past interactions, and to remember the relevant features of those
interactions, is necessary to sustain cooperation.</i> - Robert Axelrod, 1984,
p. 139</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786922">Reputations are the foundation of stable
relationships</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Reputations are the product of ongoing
interactions.But ongoing
interaction between anonymous members is not sufficient to produce cooperative
relations.Unless it is
possible for members to develop, display, and recognize their own and others
reputations, cooperative relationships cannot survive.A society of strangers is an oxymoron.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>But reputations rest upon recognition
and identity, and the variability of identity is often one of the desirable
features of online systems.A
spectrum exists between a system in which identity is fixed and always
discoverable and a system in which identity could be continuously reworked and
even hidden entirely. A central attraction of a graphical system is the ability
to create a range of bodies.It
seems likely that members will want to experiment, developing a range of
different bodies for different moods and situations.They may also want to engage in completely anonymous
interactioncertain interests and activities are too costly if real-world identities
are easily associated with online personas.In some cases, members who create interesting and attractive
bodies may be asked to share their designs, creating small armies of identical
characters.Balancing the
conflicting desire for playful identity development and the need for
accountability and recognition (in the positive and negative sense) is a
difficult challenge.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Flexible identities pose a threat to
cooperative relations in the community.Perhaps most damaging would be the ability to perfectly impersonate
another member.Absolute
anonymity could also be dangerous.The
use ofmultiple bodies may be
the least threatening, so long as a unitary identity remains discoverable.Bodies should be as distinctive as
possible to make identification ofparticular
members easier.To resolve
these conflicting interests, we also suggest that some form of license plate
identifier tag be available no matter what form the member has created for
their body.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>One suggestion might be that a
semi-autonomous zone be created within the larger space that allows some higher
level of anonymity or even mimicry.However,
this may not be desirable.The
WELL, for example, experimented briefly with anonymous conferences.The system as a whole retained its
policy of identified postings, but a small group of conferences allowed anyone
to change their user identification to anything, including another members
identity.Chaos ensued.Members used this special space to
denounce and puppet one another.Had
the interactions in these groups been contained there, this may not have been
damaging.However, members who
did not want to participate anonymously observed the activities in these groups
and took word of them out to the traditional groups.The result was damage to many peoples reputations and the
venting of malice that would otherwise have remained private.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Just as it is important to make bodies
as identifiable as possible, it is also important to make members interests
and intentions easily displayable.It
is important to allow members to recognize in others a shared interest or
membership.In face-to-face
interaction, there are a range of familiar tickets to begin an interaction.These are forms of passive signaling
(for example, buttons, T-shirts, hats, lapel pins, clothing, particular colors,
etc.) that offer members a justification to begin an interaction with otherwise
unknown others.While the
equivalent of buttons has been employed in text-based MOOs, they demand active
attentionyou must explicitly request to read them.In a graphical space, passive signals can be displayed without
members explicitly requesting them.The
move from a text- to a graphics-based environment shifts the balance between
expressions that are given (consciously expressed) towards expressions that
are given-off (unconsciously emitted;see Goffman 1959).</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc459786923"></a><a name="_Create_Clear_Boundaries"></a>Create Clear Boundaries</h2>

<p class=Body>Boundaries are the containers of culture.Groups must be able to draw boundaries around themselves, both
to create and maintain a sense of identity and to protect and regulate the
resources they collectively produce.Boundaries
can include barriers to access as well as methods for banishing individuals.Boundaries must also be visible and
obvious to signal to members when they are crossing into different territories.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in'><i>So long as the boundaries of the
resource ... remain uncertain, no one knows what is being managed or for whom</i>.
- Elinor Ostrom, 1990, p. 91.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.5in'><i>Good fences make good neighbors.</i>
- Robert Frost</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786924">Allow groups to create boundaries around themselves</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>If this world does succeed, groups will
form to create resources that they could not create individually.These collective resources must be
protected in many ways.To the
extent that groups produce resources that are publicly available, there is a
strong temptation to use the resources without moderation or contribution.Further, each group will have its
own subculture that defines its own specific norms and expectations concerning
these resources.It is
important that these groups be able to tailor their cultures to their
particular needs.Similarly,
the nature of the boundaries groups create must be flexible as well.Carefully constructed boundaries
encourage group interaction.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Any discussion of boundaries requires
that we have some understanding of what is being protected.This isnt as simple as it may seem.Groups may wish to bound a space, a
discussion, or a collection of objects, whatever they may be.Further, there are many kinds of
boundaries.Every community and
group has some inherent boundaries that serve as filters, whether they are
explicit or implicit.For
example, it would seem that anyone can join the WELL, but the difficult user
interface, the cost, and its obscurity combine to exclude many potential
members.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Boundaries to access can also be
explicit.Just as there are
private mailing lists, groups should be able to limit their membership.A fundamental example of this is the
members home.Additional
examples include private clubs and gated neighborhoods.Other groups manage their boundaries by allowing open access
but retain strong powers of banishment for transgressions.This can be understood as a kind of
group killfile.An open access
policy backed by banishment can have higher costs.Kicking someone out of a group is a more difficult task
(especially if it requires consensus) than simply excluding them from the start
(Kollock and Smith 1995).</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Boundaries provide groups with a
powerful resource for social control.The
power to effectively banish or constrain members activities allows groups to
enforce their norms and expectations (see <a href="#_Allow_Members_to">Allow
Members to Govern Their Own Behavior</a> and <a href="#_Encourage_Members_to">Encourage
Members to Enforce Their Own Rules</a>, later in this paper).Boundaries may also operate at a
smaller level, all the way down to the individual, who should be able to limit
who has access to them by blocking the messages and presence of particular
members.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>This raises some serious issues.Not all groups should have the right
to remain exclusive.It may be
necessary to limit the capacity to enforce exclusivity when groups gain
significant social power.In
addition, there is the real possibility that groups will create norms and
expectations that are illegal or distasteful and will require that their
boundaries be removed and the groups disbanded.This points to the role for an external authority (that is, the
system administrators), an issue we address in <a href="#_Encourage_Members_to">Encourage
Members to Enforce Their Own Rules</a>, later in this paper.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>A powerful model for dealing with
boundaries can be drawn from the UNIX file permissions system.A group should be able to allow
outsiders to selectively enter their spaces, join their discussions, and take
or copy their objects.Or, it
should be possible to limit this access so that only a member of a group can
open these resources to an outsider.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>A carefully constructed system of
boundaries will have the effect of creating a community of communities.For this to be sustainable, it is
necessary for members to recognize when they are passing from one community
into another.Different
communities will invariably have different norms, expectations, and potentially
even rules of physics.As a
result, boundaries should be visible and obvious.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786925">Make boundaries obvious</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Contexts are signaled by boundaries.When boundaries are not clearly
signaled, members may, like the users of AOL, find themselves in spaces that
they do not recognize as different from their own.When AOL added access to Usenet discussion groups, the link was
so seamless that users frequently ignored local norms and expectations and
applied their own instead.This
resulted in conflicts between existing Usenet members and the new AOL arrivals,
resulting in new newsgroups such as alt.aol.sucks.Instead, AOL should have made it clear that their users were
crossing a border.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Clearly marked and advertised
boundaries serve the additional function of directing like-minded members to
points of shared interest.Properly
operating boundaries create <i>Schelling
points</i>, spaces that clearly focus certain kinds of behavior and activity.A good Schelling point allows for
the kind of gradual development of relationships that was discussed in <a
href="#_Promote_Ongoing_Interaction">Promote Ongoing Interaction</a>, earlier
in this paper.For example, the
naming conventions in Usenet serve as both a boundary and as a Schelling point,
advertising the focus of the group.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc459786926"></a><a name="_Allow_Members_to"></a>Allow Members to Govern Their Own Behavior
</h2>

<p class=Body>Promote self-governance in a federated system.Groups should be able to design
rules that govern their own behavior which are well matched to local needs and
conditions.External
authorities should not unnecessarily interfere with group self-rule.Further, those group members subject
to a set of rules should be able to participate in creating, communicating, and
changing them.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786927">Support a federated system of governance</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>To the extent that it is possible,
groups that form in the virtual space should regulate themselves.Self-regulation avoids many of the
problems faced by a central or external authority.External regulation is costly, may be objectionable to the
community members, and ultimately is incapable of widespread social control.But for self-regulation to occur,
the members of groups must have the resources and rights to govern themselves.Specifically, groups must design a
set of rules that are well matched to their local needs and conditions (Ostrom
1990).This also implies that
external authorities should not unnecessarily interfere with group self-rule.The rules that govern a group should
be customizable, rather than a procrustean set of rules that are applied
mindlessly throughout the world.Further,
if the rules are to be well designed and if members of the group are to recognize
them as legitimate, it is important that most of the members subject to the
rules be allowed to participate in the process of creating, changing, and
enforcing them.This not only
follows the ideals of democratic legitimacy, but also draws the design of rules
from those most intimate with the issues and needs that face them.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Local regulation may also help relieve
the problems inherent in large groups.Self-regulating groups face serious challenges when they grow beyond a
manageable size.When small,
groups are able to leverage the small group effect that maximizes their
capacity to form a consensus and regulate themselves.Further, if groups are going to be able to locally define their
rules, only a federated system can accommodate the resulting diversity.We recommend, therefore, that the
virtual world be composed of a community of relatively autonomous communities.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786928">Problems raised by self-regulation</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>This solution is not perfect.There are a range of issues that
should be anticipated and planned for.Community standards may conflict with one another, leaving open the
question of how to reconcile them.If
groups retain total sovereignty, the larger needs of the community as a whole
may be challenged.What is
reasonable and justifiable for an individual group can have tragic consequences
for the community as a whole.Further,
there may be some forms of behavior that cannot be tolerated even when engaged
in by consensual members of a group.Should
some behavior always be considered a crime?Should there be lawless zones within the larger space?Can communities decide to limit
their members rights to speech, expression, and association?While this may seem innocuous when
the limitation is to require members to stay within the frame of a role-playing
game, it is less easy to justify if the community demands a demonstration of,
for example,Christian piety.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>These issues suggest the need for a
virtual world-wide constitution of rights and responsibilities that defines the
outer limits of autonomy for individuals and groups.Within these limits there can be great variation.These distinctions are made more
acceptable when, as we noted in <a href="#_Create_Clear_Boundaries">Create Clear
Boundaries</a>, the boundaries are clearly marked and explained (for example,
marking the transition into a territory that allows virtual theft or violence).</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc459786929"></a><a name="_Encourage_Members_to"></a>Encourage Members to Enforce Their Own Rules</h2>

<p class=Body>Self-governance rests on the groups capacity to control its
members actions.This process
involves a range of activities including socialization, monitoring,
sanctioning, and dispute resolution.Each
of these activities is best accomplished by the group members themselves.There should be a wide range of
sanctions (from trivial to severe) available to groups.Members should also have access to low-cost conflict resolution
mechanisms.In addition, there
is an important, although limited, role for external authority.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786930">Self-regulation</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Technical solutions are not substitutes
for social solutions.No matter
how cleverly constructed, the tools to shape interaction will be incapable of
restraining everything that is seen as offensive, immoral, uncooperative,
destructive, or illegal.In all
but the last instance, the group itself is best suited to deal with these
problems.However, to do so
they must have the right tools and the right to use them.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786931">Support the socialization ofnew members</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Many members of a community will follow
the rules, norms, and expectations set by that group if they are aware of them
and they are comprehensible and coherent.This requires that the community have effective means to communicate
their local culture.One of the
most effective ways of accomplishing this is to provide institutional memory, a
store of past activities, debates, and decisions that are open to new members.To achieve this goal, we suggest
that the system provide tools to archive and retrieve texts and other documents
along with the recording of synchronous interaction.For example, in many MOOs videotapes are available to record
all the activity in a particular room.These tapes have been used to great effect.Recordings are available of past community council meetings,
lively social debates, and instructional lectures on using the various features
of the system.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>If this is done well, the costs of
active socialization (in which existing members directly inform new members of
the local culture) are significantly reduced. Because socialization is often
costly, many existing members can be quickly overwhelmed by the task of
socializing large numbers of newcomers.The result is sometimes the withdrawal of experienced members and a
complete refusal to participate in socialization activities.To avoid this tragic outcome, we
also recommend providing incentives to those willing to perform socialization
tasks.These incentives may
take the form of tokens, status markers, public recognition, discounts, or
other benefits.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786932">Let members monitor their own groups</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Like socialization, monitoring is best
undertaken by members themselves.Self-policing
groups are able to take advantage of the fact that members are in close and
frequent contact with one another. Monitoring is useful not only to identify
transgressions of local rules and normsit also has the effect of generating
reputations.Here is another
reason why a formal spatial model is useful.When members are frequently co-present, even when only in
passing, they are able to create and update information about each others
behavior, reliability, interests, and associations.Although these are aspects of individual identity that are
often considered private, in practice social groups and individuals benefit
from local public knowledge about members.Such knowledge allows members to refer one another to others
who may share interests or are able to provide desired services.These social network connections
depend upon a stock of general knowledge about a range of other members.While a directory of interests is
one alternative to direct introductions, such a system misses the value of a
personal contact that can often ease the formation of a new social
relationship. </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786933">Let groups sanction their own members</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Monitoring others activities will
inevitably uncover transgressions of the local rules and norms.Punishing transgressions is an
import activity for any social group.Without
the capacity to sanction, a group can be quickly overrun by members who deplete
common resources or refuse to contribute to common goods.Once again, sanctioning is best
accomplished by the community members themselves; members have more detailed
local knowledge about the context and content of the transgression.For example, a local group member is
likely to know if this is the first time that another member has violated a
rule or norm.The result is
that sanctions can be graduated to fit the particulars of the transgression.There should be a broad menu of
sanctions that vary from the minor to the severe so that a blunt instrument
does not have to be used to shape behavior.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786934">Let members resolve their own disputes</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Regardless of how well designed a
groups rules are, disputes will arise over whether a particular action is in
fact a violation of the local rules or norms.In addition, rules may be challenged, their legitimacy
questioned, or they may conflict with other rules.These disputes are also best left to the community to resolve.If disputes are resolved locally,
the costs of resolution are likely to be lower than if they are brought to an
external authority.Further, if
an external authority is available, it is likely to be quickly swamped by
trivial disputes while eroding the groups internal capacity to self-regulate.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>But declaring that a group ought to be
able to resolve its own disputes fails to recognize just how formidable a task
this is.In general, groups
evolve a collection of resolution mechanisms that in practice look far less
attractive than a formal judiciary.A
common model is resolution by exhaustion, in which a dispute is argued and
debated at length, being resolved only when the parties to the dispute lose
patience or lack the endurance to continue.This process creates a significant amount of noise and can be
annoying.However, it is one of
the most common methods and it is often effective.A common alternative is resolution by fiat in which a member of
high status or formal power (such as a wizard in a MOO, or a group moderator)
simply forces a resolution, perhaps after the failure of the prior method.Between these alternatives are a
range of formalized but still local dispute resolution mechanisms.For example, MicroMuse has
designated certain members as conflict mediators.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786935">The role for external authority</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>When an external authoritys
involvement cannot be avoided, it is important that intervention be carried out
as much as possible in and through existing local institutions.For system administrators to simply
step into an ongoing dispute and revoke accounts, banish members, or take and
return property is asking for trouble.The system administrators disproportionate power should be used
judiciously.A well-known
example of this comes from Habitat, one of the earliest graphical virtual
spaces.In Habitat, a tool
intended to be available only to system administrators fell into the hands of a
normal member who then used it to wreak havoc.The initial response was to simply delete the object from the
possession of the member.The
result was an enormous protest and the shredding of the sense of place that had
been carefully built-up over time.Upon
reflection, the object was returned to the member and the system administrators
entered the system as characters in order to negotiate for its return.This restored the sense of social
coherence to the space and created a great story to tell.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc459786936"></a><a name="_Create_an_Internal"></a>Create an Internal Economy</h2>

<p class=Body>Central planning is impossible, and members are more likely to
contribute to the world if there is value in the community and if exchange is
facilitated.Members will value
the community to the extent that they are able to have a consequential effect
on the environment and build social ties.Objects within the community will be valued to the extent they are
scarce, and this scarcity should at times be designed into the community.Exchange should be facilitated by
providing an internal currency and clearly defined principles of ownership.Members behavior should be organized
on the basis of incentives whenever possible rather then simply prohibiting
particular behaviors.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786937">Create value internally</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Objects and activities that are highly
valued will inevitably emerge in any community.However, it is useful to consider the sources of value, both to
encourage the development of valuable goods and services in the community and
to avoid unintentionally creating obstacles to the creation of such value.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Members will value the community to the
extent that they are able to fulfill their key desires.There are many sources of value, but people are primarily
concerned with <i>efficacy</i> and <i>intimacy</i>.That is, if individuals are to be long-term members and
productive in the community, they must be able to have a consequential effect
on their environment and build close social ties.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>In addition to efficacy and intimacy,
individuals are often concerned with both status and aesthetics.There should be positions of marked
respect and power in the community for those who emerge as leaders and key contributors
to collective goods.It is also
important that members be able to build and display objects of beauty.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Objects in the community will be
valuable to the extent that they are scarce.Scarcity can be the result of many factors.An object will be scarce if:it requires many people to produce;
takes a great deal of time to produce; requires extensive travel to various
areas in the world; is composed of rare natural resources; can only be
created by an especially talented person; or if the object is created by
someone of great reputation.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>In some instances, it may be useful to
create some forms of scarcity in the community to encourage certain outcomes.As we mentioned above, if building a
better house requires that a number of people work together, this will
encourage group activities and encourage ongoing reciprocal exchange between
community members.It is even
possible that some members will come to specialize in certain challenging tasks
and so offer valuable services in exchange for some resource (see the next
section).As an additional
example, if certain useful and rare objects require raw materials from
different areas in the world, this would encourage trading relations between
different communities within the world.This argues for a variegated environment rather than one in which each
community has precisely the same resources as all the others.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786938">Facilitate exchange</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>The creation of value in the community
will be greatly facilitated if there is a system of internal currency.An internal currency serves two
important roles.First, it
functions as an efficient store of value.Members can convert objects of value into currency rather than needing
to maintain a potentially extensive inventory of objects and structures.The second important function of an
internal currency is that it facilitates exchange by providing a commonmedium of payment and a way of
fixing prices.In contrast, a
barter system is a less efficient means of exchanging goods and services.(In the end, both exchange based on
currency and the barter system are likely to coexist in the world.The point is that members should
have the option of using currency for their transactions.)</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>The effects of an internal currency on
motivating and coordinating behavior were clearly seen in Habitat (Morningstar
and Farmer 1991).The simple
fact that goods were available for different prices in different areas of
Habitat encouraged some members to become specialists in the transportation of
goods in order to realize a profit.In
this case, the goods were simply redeemed in a vending machine, but there is
no reason the activity could not be made social by creating markets and bazaars
for the trading of goods.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>As the world becomes larger and more
complex, it will probably also be necessary to provide a means for members to
enter into enforceable contracts with each other.However, the design of the community should not eliminate all
sources of risk (indeed, this would be impossible).Although it is important to provide means for securing the
terms of some exchanges, the presence of risky transactions is actually very
important.Trust emerges in a
group only if there is a test of that trust (Kollock 1993).In a situation in which there is no
risk, neither exploitation nor high levels of solidarity emerge.One approach would be to allow
contracts, but to attach some cost to creating one so that they are used only
in some circumstances.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Healthy exchange also requires a clear
sense of ownership, that is, property rights.As we discussed in <a href="#_Create_Clear_Boundaries">Create
Clear Boundaries</a>, there should be ways of marking an object or territory
as the property of a particular person or group.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc459786939">Avoid central planning</a></h3>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>Another critical lesson from Habitat is
that central planning is impossible.Instead,
the best approach is a well-designed set of tools and incentives so that
members are both motivated and able to add to the world.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:.25in'>This is not to say there should be no
oversight at all. There will be a role for various kinds of architectural
review boards in order to insure some minimal consistency in how objects are
built and the world is extended.Further,
as we have discussed above, there are many circumstances in which reasonable
behavior on the part of the individual can aggregate to cause collective
disaster.The recommendations
we have proposed are designed to encourage as much as possible local control
and regulation of these situations, but there are likely to be a limited set of
situations in which the system administrators must step in to prohibit or
require certain actions (for example, a limit on the rate at which objects
might be built if this threatens to deplete scarce bandwidth or other common
system resources).This should
be done only when absolutely necessary.In general, it is much better to encourage or discourage various
behaviors through the use of incentives rather than simply prohibiting an
action by writing code that makes the action impossible.As an example, teleporting (moving instantly from one area to
another, perhaps very remote area) is made impossible in some MOOs because it
is felt that teleporting is disruptive and confusing.Another approach would be to make teleporting possible but
expensive, and in a complementary way, make methods of transportation that have
beneficial side effects free or inexpensive.Thus, walking or riding a virtual bus, which creates a great
deal of by-the-way interaction, might be free, while solo forms of travel
would be priced higher.</p>
