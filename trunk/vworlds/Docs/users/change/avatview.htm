<h1>Avatar Overview</h1>

<p>
Your avatar is your graphical representation in a virtual
world environment. You can chat with other avatars in your world. When you first log into a world, you are assigned
the default avatar, an artist's wooden model. You can change this avatar in your <b>Profile</b>. 
<p>

<h2>Profiles</h2>

<p>
You can show personal information in your avatar's profile, or keep that information visible only to friends or just 
to yourself. The profile information includes the chosen avatar graphic, description, and information to display
on where you are from, your age, your email, and your real name. The avatar's profile also includes a list of avatars
that you asked to be your friends, and a list of avatars that you are ignoring. 
<p>
You can view profiles of other avatars as well. The amount of information you can see depends on what they set their
permission levels to for each detail; if you're a friend of that avatar, you can see the friends information as well
as the public information. 
<p>

<h2>Permission Levels for Avatars</h2>
<p>
There are several levels of access in Microsoft Virtual Worlds. This access limits or permits each avatar to
create objects or change objects that belong to other people, as well as remove people from conversations. 

These are the levels of access in Microsoft Virtual Worlds: Residents (visitors to the completed world), Hosts
(avatars who can remove people from the world for conversational purposes), Authors (avatars who can create
objects in the world), Wizards (creators and designers of objects in world), and Owners (creator/designer of
the world). 

<h2>Avatars Specific to a Computer</h2>
<p>
Avatars are closely tied to the computer that you use to access the virtual world environment. If you create an
avatar named George on your computer, you can only use that computer to access the world with George. If you move
to another computer running Microsoft Virtual Worlds, you must create a new avatar to access the world.
