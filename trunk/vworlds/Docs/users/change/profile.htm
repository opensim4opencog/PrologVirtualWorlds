<h1>What are Profiles?</h1>

<p>Each avatar in a virtual world is represented by a graphical image and a profile. The
profile is seen when you click on that avatar for more details. Your avatar has a profile
as well, and you can use that profile to change any of the following information: 

<ul>
  <li>Appearance </li>
  <li>Description </li>
  <li>Details </li>
  <li>Friends </li>
  <li>Ignored </li>
</ul>

<h2>Appearance</h2>

<p>You can choose an avatar to represent you in the world from the list of prepared
avatars. Once you choose an avatar, you can test the gestures and poses of the avatar with
the buttons. The avatar you currently have in the world is not updated until you click <b>OK</b>.
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This is one of the attributes that other avatars can see if they look at your profile.
You can type in text, describing yourself or anything you want to say about yourself. </p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Details include personal information about yourself, such as where you live, your
gender, your real name, age, email alias and web page. You don't have to provide any
information that you are not comfortable with. You can set the individual viewing
privileges for each detail, as well, to be seen by the public (everyone), only your
friends (avatars in the Friends list), or only yourself (private).</p>

<h2>Friends</h2>

<p>You can save your favorite avatars' names in a <b>Friends List</b> in your own <b>Profile</b>.
Friends can see information in your <b>Profile</b> that regular people cannot, if you set
that information to the <b>Friends</b> level. For example, if you didn't want your age or
location to be seen by all on your avatar's<b> Details</b> page, you could set the age and
location fields to be visible only to <b>Friends</b>. Everyone else would not see age or
location. </p>

<h2>Ignored</h2>

<p>When an avatar is added to your <b>Ignore List</b>, that avatar graphic appears to be a
cat stuffed in a bottle (to you.) You no longer see their messages and the room hears a
message that you are ignoring that particular avatar. Other avatars can still
&quot;hear&quot; the messages from the avatar you are ignoring. </p>
