<h1>Selecting an Avatar</h1>
<p>
Every time you log on to Microsoft Virtual Worlds, you use an avatar to represent yourself in the virtual world
environment. You can choose the avatar you want from the Virtual Worlds Start page. Choose the nickname for that 
avatar, and the avatar is created with the default avatar graphic, the artist's stick figure. 
<p>
Each avatar you create can have a distinctive profile, image, and name; these avatars are specific to the computer 
you create them on and you cannot access them on a different computer. Each avatar name must be unique for that 
computer and that world; if there is already a "Bill" in the world, the world appends more numbers to create "Bill1"
and "Bill2." 
<p>
You can create as many avatars as you want; you can delete avatars as well. If you delete an avatar, you lose all the 
profile information for that avatar as well. 
<p>
