  <P>
 One of the ways to add life to a conversation is by using gestures while you
 talk to other avatars. You have a variety of gestures to choose from, represented by small buttons marked  in the avatar pane. When you click a gesture button, your avatar performs a sequence of motions,
 returning to the idle stance when finished. The <b>Chat History</b> pane shows that you performed a gesture.
 <P>
 Gestures are best viewed from the front of the avatar that is gesturing. You can also change your camera angle
 to place the camera in front of you, to see your own gesture. The gesture is also acted out in the avatar
 preview, which is displayed above the gesture buttons.
 <P>
 Different avatar models do different types of motions for each gesture. You can preview these when you select
 your avatar in the <b>Profile</b> menu, in the <b>Appearance</b> page. You can click gesture buttons as you preview the
 avatar model to see what they will do.
