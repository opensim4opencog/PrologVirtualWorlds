  <H1>Communicating in Microsoft Virtual Worlds</H1>
  <P>
The worlds created in Microsoft Virtual Worlds are social environments, where people can gather to exchange 
similar ideas. Since you are represented by an avatar, it is completely up to you whether you want to reveal 
your real identity, your physical appearance, your age, or any other personal information. You can speak and
be heard without any of the stress we encounter in large groups in real life situations. 
<p>
There are many ways to communicate in Virtual Worlds:
<ul>
	<LI> Talking (typing in text). </li>
	<li> Gesturing (with the avatar).
	<li> Emoting (showing emotions).
	<li> Whispering (talking only to select people in a room). 
	<li> Making friends of other avatars.
	<LI> Ignoring/silencing avatars. </li>
 </ul>

<H2>Talking</h2>
To speak in a virtual world, you type text into a window. The text is not visible, or broadcast, until you
hit the <b>Enter</b> key. 
<p>
When you say something, the text is broadcast to all the other avatars and objects in that 
room. Avatars in other rooms in the world may not be able to hear what you said. Distance between avatars
does not matter. If you are speaking to an avatar, they do not have to be in your avatar's direct line of
sight. 
<p>
You can read the replies from the other avatars in the chat window area. This window, or history of the 
conversation, starts recording the minute you step into the room. 
<p>
There are common protocols for speaking through text:
<ul>
<li>Typing in ALL CAPITALS is generally seen as yelling the capitalized words.
<li>Be polite to strangers. You never know who might be lurking behind that avatar.
<LI>If someone doesn't want to talk with you, then move on. There are plenty of people to talk to and
things to see in Microsoft Virtual Worlds.
<li>Politeness and basic good manners go a long way in virtual world communities. People in the community
remember you by your actions and how you present yourself, so if you're there to be social, don't be rude. 
</ul><P>
You might see avatars using acronyms as expressions. These acronyms are from the web (check the web for a 
more comprehensive list). Here are some of the basic expressions:
<ul>
<li>LOL - Laughing Out Loud
<li>ROTFL - Rolling On The Floor Laughing
<li>BRB - Be Right Back
<li>IMO - In My Opinion
<li>IMHO - In My Humble/Honest Opinion
</ul>
These can also be combined with the corresponding gestures to add to the flavor of a conversation. For 
instance, if you need to leave the keyboard for a short bit, you can click the sleep gesture and type in BRB. 

<h2>Gesturing</h2>
To gesture in a virtual world, you can click one of the gesture buttons. Your avatar does the gesture, as you
can see in the avatar preview. 
<P>
Gestures are very useful in responding quickly to a remark or helping add flash to a conversation, such as
a laugh, a shrug, or a funny pose. In Virtual
Worlds, the gestures of an avatar are generally only visible on the front of the gesturing avatar, so if you 
are behind them, or moved to the side, you may not see the entire gesture on the avatar itself. You will see
the gesture announced to the room in the chat window. 
<P>


<h2>Showing Emotions</h2>
There is a convention for virtual environments called "emoting." Emoting is shown in text-based chats by
typing smiling faces sideways, such as : ). In Microsoft Virtual Worlds, you can emote in your text, and the
text-looking sideways smiley face is replaced with a smiling face graphic in the chat line. 
<P>
You can also show emotion by appending the text you type after your name. For example: 
<P>
Spoken text: Jane says "Hi Jack!"<br>
Emoted text: Jane waves hi to Jack. 
<P>
<h2>Whispering</h2>
You can "whisper," or speak privately, to avatars you select. Whispered speech appears in the conversation 
window to you, but only to you and the other avatar(s) you sent the whisper to. <b></b> In Microsoft Virtual Worlds,
you can set up lists of avatars to whisper to within a room or within a world. 
<p>

<h2>Making Friends</h2>
As you get to know the people online, recognizing certain avatar nicknames and conversation styles, you may
want to keep track of your favorite avatars. You can do this with a friends list, which is part of your 
specific avatar's profile. (Each avatar you use may keep a different profile, and thus, a different friends
list.)
<p>
When you add another avatar to your list, the other avatar receives a message saying that you are asking if
they can be added to your friends list. They can accept or decline this invitation. You may receive this 
message yourself if someone else wants to make you their friend. 
<p>

<h2>Ignoring/Silencing Other Avatars</h2>
As you start talking to new avatars online, you may find people whose conversation no longer interests you, 
or even bothers you. You can mute these people, for any span of time that you like. You can add them to an
Ignore list that is part of your specific avatar's profile. The avatar that you are ignoring will change
into a new picture, that of a cat in a bottle, to represent that you are no longer listening to them.
<p>
When you silence another avatar by ignoring them, a message is broadcast to the room that you are ignoring
that avatar. This ignored status lasts as long - or as short - as you want it to. Other avatars are still 
able to hear the avatar you are ignoring, unless they ignore that avatar as well.
