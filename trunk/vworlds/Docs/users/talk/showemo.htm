  <H1>Showing Emotions</H1>
  <P>
  During a conversation in Microsoft Virtual Worlds, you may want to show emotion without using the gesture
  buttons, by "posing" an action near your name in the <b>Chat</b> window. You can do this by typing in text to be
  added after your name, but not spoken aloud.  
  <p>
  You can also do gestures, which animate your avatar with a series of images. 
   
<h4>To show emotion/action in the <b>Chat</b> window:</h4>
  <OL>
	<li>Type in the text that you want added after your name.
	<li>Click the <b>Emote</b> button.  <img src="../../images/emotbutn.bmp" width=21 height=24 alt="" border="0">
<p>
	You can type in an emotion or posture text in the chat box and click the gesture button of your choice. 
	Your emotion or posture text appears next to your name as your avatar performs the gesture. 
   </OL>
   
 <h4>Example of Showing Emotion</h4>
 Jane wants to simulate poking Jim in the ribs. She can't actually poke Jim in the ribs; but she can
 use emoting to fake it by putting an action statement after her name in the <b>Chat</b> window.  
 <p>
 Jane types:
 <p>
<b>pokes Jim in the ribs.</b>
<p>
Then she clicks the Emote button. Virtual Worlds displays:
<p>
  <b>Jane pokes Jim in the ribs.</b>
