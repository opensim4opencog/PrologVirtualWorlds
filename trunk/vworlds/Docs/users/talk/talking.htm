  <H1>Talking to People</H1>
  
In Microsoft Virtual Worlds, you can speak by typing your words into a window and then pressing <b>Enter</b>. 
Before you press <b>Enter</b>, you can change your mind or edit the words in the <b>Chat</b> window. After you press
<b>Enter</b>, all the avatars in the same room as you can see your message. Avatars in other rooms will not
see your "spoken" text. 
<p>
If you are speaking to an avatar, they do not have to be in your avatar's direct line of
sight to receive your message. Distance between avatars within the same room does not matter. 
<p>
You can read the messages from other avatars in the <b>Chat</b> window. This window, or history of the 
conversation, starts recording the minute you step into the room. You can scroll up to see previous statements, 
emotions, and other messages from other avatars, back to the point where you
entered the room.

<b>Jane says, "Try taking the letter." </b>
