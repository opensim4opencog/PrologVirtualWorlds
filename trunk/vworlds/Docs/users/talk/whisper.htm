  <H1>Whispering</H1>
  <P>
   If you want to say something privately to one or more avatars in the room, you can whisper your
   message to them. Only the avatars you select in the <b>Whisper</b> dialog box see your whispered message.
    The <b>Chat History</b> pane shows, only to you and your whisper targets, the message that you whispered. 
  <P>
  When another avatar whispers to you, the message appears in the <b>Chat Window</b>, but only to you and the other
  people specifically marked for that whisper message. For example, 
 <p> 
  Avatar1 whispers to Admin, "Purple walls would look better." 
  <p>
