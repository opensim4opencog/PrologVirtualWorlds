  <H1>Ignoring and Silencing People</H1>
  
As you join in conversation with other avatars in Microsoft Virtual Worlds, you may discover that you 
do not want to read the "spoken" comments from certain avatars. You can filter their "spoken" messages
from your <b>Chat</b> window by adding that avatar to your Ignore List. 
<P>
When an avatar is added to your <b>Ignore List</b>, that avatar graphic appears to be a cat
stuffed in a bottle (to you.) You no longer see their messages and the room hears a message that you are
ignoring that particular avatar. Other avatars can still "hear" the messages from the avatar you are
ignoring. 
<P>
The list of avatars that you are ignoring is in your avatar <b>Profile</b>. You can take people off the list there.
The list is saved with your avatar even when you move to another room or another world, or log off and 
back on. 
<p>
  
<h4>To ignore or silence an avatar:</h4>
  <OL>
   <li>Right-click on the avatar that you want to ignore, or left-click the name of the avatar in the 
   <b>People</b> pane. 
   <li>Click <b>Ignore</b>. <P>
   A message is sent to that avatar that says, <b>"(NAME) is ignoring you."</b><BR>
   That avatar is added to your <b>Ignore List</b> in your avatar's <b>Profile</b>.
   <P>
   
   </OL>
<h4>To stop ignoring an avatar:</h4>
<ol>
<li> In the <b>People</b> pane, left-click on your own avatar's name. 
<li> Select <b>Profile</b>. 
<li> Select <b>Ignore List</b>.
<li> Select the avatar's name and click <b>Remove</b>. 
</ol>
  <P>
