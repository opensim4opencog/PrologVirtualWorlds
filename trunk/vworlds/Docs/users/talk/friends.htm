  <H1>Adding People to the Friends List</H1>
  
   In Microsoft Virtual Worlds, you will probably meet many interesting avatars. You can save your favorite
   avatars' names in a <b>Friends List</b> in your own <b>Profile</b>. Friends can see information in your
   <b>Profile</b> that 
   regular people cannot, if you set that information to the <b>Friends</b> level. For example, if you didn't want
   your age or location to be seen by all on your avatar's<b> Details</b> page, you could set the age and location
   fields to be visible only to <b>Friends</b>. Everyone else would not see age or location. 
   <P>
   When you make a friend, the receiving avatar is asked if they want to accept or not. You may see this message
   yourself if someone wants to make you their friend. 
  <p>
  
<h4>To add a friend to your <b>Friends List</b>:</h4>
  <OL>
   <li>Right-click on the avatar that you want to add to the list, or left-click the name of the avatar in the 
   <b>Avatars</b> pane. 
   <li>Click <b>Add to Friends List</b>. <P>
   A message is sent to that avatar that says, "Allow (NAME) to make you a friend?"<BR>
   If the other avatar clicks <b>Yes</b>, they are added to your <b>Friends List</b>.
   <P>
   You can reach that list through your
   <b>Profile</b>. Their name changes to blue in the <b>Avatars</b> pane. 
   </OL>
  <P>
