<h1>Moving Around a World</h1>

<p>Virtual worlds are a bit different from real life - especially when you are moving
around inside the space. You are no longer constrained to how far you can walk in a day -
even walking is optional. Flying is fairly normal in most worlds (unless gravity is turned
on). </p>

<p>In Microsoft Virtual Worlds, you can expect to scoot about at the touch of a mouse or
the keyboard, right up to and sometimes through objects. No guarantees that objects are
solid. Running into what looks like a door or a window may or may not do anything.
Outdoors areas are called &quot;rooms,&quot; too, since they are a defined space in the
world. There is no size limit on how big - or how small - a room can be. In Microsoft
Virtual Worlds, you can: 

<ul>
  <li>Run into invisible boundaries </li>
  <li>Teleport to other rooms via Portals </li>
  <li>Approach objects and other avatars </li>
  <li>Move to other worlds </li>
</ul>

<h2>Running Into Invisible Boundaries</h2>

<p>Some objects you cannot go through - they are solid and they have a boundary, an
imaginary force field, to keep you from passing into or through them. Owners and authors
can set boundaries anywhere in worlds or rooms to restrict the movement of avatars. You'll
know if you &quot;hit&quot; one - you'll slide to the left or right but make no more
progress in your original direction. </p>

<p>Boundaries can also be placed in the sky, in the floor, or with a certain height limit.
Boundaries are not always straight - you can encounter curved boundaries as well. </p>

<h2>Using Portals to Move Between Rooms</h2>

<p>You can move with the mouse or the keyboard. You can also move to other rooms. You use
&quot;portals&quot; or doorways for this. Portals are invisible tunnels that connect rooms
to other rooms. They appear as doors by default. Run into or right-click the door, and if
it is a portal, a message appears, or check the room inventory to see if there are any
portals listed to other places. </p>

<h2>Approaching Objects and Other Avatars</h2>

<p>In Microsoft Virtual Worlds, you can select a particular object or avatar to
&quot;approach.&quot; When you approach something, you travel to the &quot;front&quot; of
that object as fast as possible, passing through everything in route, even objects that
are normally solid. The creator of the object sets the distance that you stop in front of
the object on an approach. This is so that you can see the whole object (especially
important if the object is very tall or large). </p>

<p>When you approach another avatar, you whisk through everything to end up standing in
front of the avatar. This is usually a signal to talk to each other in virtual world
protocol. </p>

<p>If you ever get stuck moving around, you can sometimes use the approach command to
force your avatar into an area where you know the geography and the boundaries better. </p>

<h2>Moving to Other Worlds</h2>

<p>You can also change worlds at any time by logging off your current world and logging
into a different one, or you can check the <strong>Directory</strong> dialog box. </p>

<p>The <strong>Directory</strong> dialog box lists all the worlds available to you on the
network, with the name of the world, name of the server, and how many people are in the
world at that point in time. You can sort that dialog box by number of people if you want
to go somewhere really crowded or really empty. </p>

<p>When you switch, your avatar suddenly vanishes from the world you are in, and reappears
in the new world you chose. This can be highly disconcerting to people who were just
talking to you, so make sure you broadcast your intentions of leaving before you
disappear. </p>
