<h1>Moving Between Worlds</h1>

<p>Travel is simple in the virtual world environment. You can switch from one world to
another at the click of a mouse. When you leave a world, you disappear, and after the room
loads, you appear in the new one. </p>

<p>In Microsoft Virtual Worlds, you can &quot;teleport&quot; to different virtual worlds
with the Directory dialog box. Worlds are listed by the server and world name, number of
users, and any informational websites that may be related. You can sort the columns by
clicking the title of the column. This is useful for locating the world that contains the
most people, or the fewest. </p>

<p>The web site can list any protocols, history, download size, or other information about
the world. </p>

<p>Remember, it is usually good manners to announce your intent to leave before departing
a conversation. </p>

information on that world. </p>
