  <H1>Approaching Objects and Avatars</H1>
  <P>
   In Microsoft Virtual Worlds, you can select a particular object or avatar to "approach." When you approach
  something, you travel to the "front" of that object as fast as possible, passing through everything in route, 
  even objects that are normally solid. The creator of the object sets the distance that you stop in front
  of the object on an approach. This is so that you can see the whole object (especially important if the
  object is very tall or large). 
  <p>
  When you approach another avatar, you whisk through everything to end up standing in front of the avatar. This 
  is usually a signal to talk to each other in virtual world protocol. 
  <p>
  If you ever get stuck moving around, you can sometimes use the approach command to force your avatar into
  an area where you know the geography and the boundaries better.
