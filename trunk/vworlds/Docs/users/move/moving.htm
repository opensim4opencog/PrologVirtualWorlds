<h1>Moving Your Avatar</h1>

<p>The advantage to three-dimensional worlds is that you can move in three dimensions. You
can navigate your avatar forwards, backwards, left and right, but also up and down. The
view of the world changes as you move your avatar into rooms, around tables, out the door,
by the tree, or up in the air. You can turn in place by turning left or right, to see the
panoramic view of the world. </p>

<p>If your camera angle is set to behind you, you might see through walls to see over your
avatar's shoulder. </p>

<h4>To move your avatar with the mouse:</h4>

<ol>

  <li>&quot;Push&quot; the mouse forward or back, left or right, and your avatar moves inside
    of the world. </li>
</ol>

<h4>To &quot;fly&quot; or move upwards or downwards with the mouse:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>With the mouse: Click the graphical view of the world and hold down the CTRL key. </li>
