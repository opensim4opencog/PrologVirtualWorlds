<h1>Logging Into and Logging Off Virtual Worlds</h1>
<p>
Microsoft Virtual Worlds uses two programs to display a virtual world: the Virtual Worlds Server
application, which stores all the worlds, and the Virtual Worlds Client application, where you can
select worlds to visit. Before you can log on to any virtual world, the Virtual Worlds Server application
must be running,
either on your computer or a computer on a network. The Server application contains the
worlds you can visit. 
<p>
<h4>To log into a virtual world:</h4>
<ol>
<li>On the <b>Start</b> menu, choose <b>Progams</b>, then click <b>Microsoft Virtual Worlds</b>.
<li>Select <b>Virtual Worlds</b>. 
<p>
The <b>Microsoft Virtual Worlds</b> <b>Start</b> screen appears. 
<li>If this is your first visit, enter an avatar nickname. Avatar names can be 3 to 12 alphanumeric characters. You 
can add spaces by using the underscore character. 
<li>Enter a destination, server name first, then a / character, then the world name. Click <b>Go</b>.
<p>
- OR -
<p>
You can also choose a world from the <b>Directory</b> dialog box. Click <b>Directory</b> to see the list of
worlds online at the moment, and click on the world you want to visit. 
</ol><p>
The Virtual Worlds client is loaded and you are logged into a virtual world. You can talk to other people,
manipulate objects, move around the space, or change your avatar's profile.</p>
<p>
You can run multiple instances of the Virtual Worlds Client
application to run multiple avatars, but you can put only one
specific avatar into a specific world at any time. Your avatars are specific to your computer.
<p>
<h4>To log off of a virtual world:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Click <b>Log Off</b> from the Virtual Worlds menu bar. 
<li>Click <b>OK</b> to navigate away from the web page.
<p>
The Virtual Worlds <b>Start</b> screen appears, and you can choose a different avatar or world, or close the Start
screen. 
</ol>
<p>
If you are in a virtual world and decide to change worlds, you
can click <b>Directory</b> to select a different world
and teleport there. If you select a new world, you are
automatically logged off from the old world and logged on to the
new world.
