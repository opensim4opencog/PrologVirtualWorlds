  <H1>Examining, Taking, and Dropping Objects</H1>
  <P>
    Objects always have descriptions. These descriptions are set by the creator of the object; the owner, a wizard,
 or an author. Descriptions can also be used as messages, such as a letter or book object. 
 <P>
 Objects can be set to be picked up and dropped. Any avatar can scoop up an object that has Take on the right-
 mouse menu. Objects cannot be carried between worlds; your inventory is suspended, invisibly, in the world
  you left until you return. 
<p>
World owners, wizards, and authors can change the properties of an object so that it can be picked up and dropped.
These three types of avatars can also change the description of an object.
