  <H1>How Do Objects Work in Virtual Worlds?</H1>
  
  Virtual worlds are not ruled by the same physics limitations as the same real items in the real world.
  Everything in the virtual world environment is considered an object: a wall, a vase, a floor, the sky, a
  tree, the dog, the person, an active avatar, a portal to another room, the world itself, are all considered
  objects.

  This is useful because world owners, wizards, and authors can then program the objects to do different
  behaviors when you react with them. In Microsoft Virtual Worlds, what you can do with an object is defined
  by what menu items are available when you right-click on an object in the graphical view of the world. 
  Some objects have only a description about themselves; such as the trees or hedge in an area. Other objects
  may have settings, such as play piano, take piano, or see More About the piano. 
  <p>
  The most common interactions with an object are:
   <ul>
  <li>finding out more about an object.
  <LI>taking and dropping objects.
  <li>approaching objects.
  <li>going through a portal object.
  <li>showing a web page object. 
  <li>wearing accessories on your avatar.
  </ul>
 
 <h2>Finding Out More About An Object</h2>
 
 Objects always have descriptions. These descriptions are set by the creator of the object; the owner, a wizard,
 or an author. Descriptions can also be used as messages, such as a letter or book object. 
 <P>
 <h2>Taking and Dropping Objects</h2>
 Objects can be set to be picked up and dropped. Any avatar can scoop up an object that has Take on the right-
 mouse menu. Objects cannot be carried between worlds; your inventory is suspended, invisibly, in the world
  you left until you return. 
  <P>
<h2>Approaching Objects</h2>
Objects can always be approached. When you approach an object, you are whisked through everything to end up
standing in front of the object, at the distance set by the creator of the object. You can approach avatars, 
too, although it is usually a signal to that avatar that you want to talk to them. 
<p>
<h2>Going Through a Portal Object</h2>
Portal objects are tunnels to adjoining rooms in the world. Sometimes portals are invisible. Among the usual
object actions, you can Go Through a portal to the destination room. You can do this from the Room Inventory,
without having to approach the portal with your avatar personally. 
<p>
There are also InterWorld Portals; these are the same except they lead to other worlds, not rooms. Your 
inventory changes between worlds to match the inventory of the new world; the old inventory is in limbo until
you go back. 
<p>
<h2>Showing a Web Page Object</h2>
Web Page objects are objects that display a web page without the browser controls. Click Show on the object's menu
to see the web page. You can navigate any links on the web page. You do not need to be near or approach 
the object to show the web page, instead you can choose the menu command from the Room Inventory. 
<P>
<h2>Wearing Accessories on Your Avatar</h2>
There is a special type of object, an accessory, that avatars can wear. When you wear these accessories, the 
picture of the object, such as a hat, is added to your avatar for all to view.
