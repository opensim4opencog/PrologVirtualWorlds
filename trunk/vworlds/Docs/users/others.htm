<h1>What are Owners, Wizards, Authors, and Hosts?</h1>
<p>
There are several levels of access in Microsoft Virtual Worlds. This access limits or allows each avatar to
create objects or change objects that belong to other people, as well as remove people from conversations. 

These are the levels of access in Microsoft Virtual Worlds: 

<ul>
  <li>Residents (visitors to the completed world)</li>
   <li>Hosts (can remove people from the world for conversational purposes)
   <li>Authors (can create objects in the world)</li>
   <li>Wizards (creators and designers of objects in world)
  <li>Owners (creator/designer of the world)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Residents</h2>

<p>When a world is completed, the people who load the Virtual Worlds client interface and
go to that world are residents. They are not creating objects or modifying the world -
they are there to experience the world, talk and whisper to other people, take and drop
objects, and move around the world. </p>

<h3>Example of Residents</h3>

<p>Jane creates a Den world for her cub scouts, and places objects in it to help the
scouts jump to the right web pages, so they can research their merit badges. The scouts
enter the world with only the client software, as residents. They can take and drop
objects, talk to each other about their goals and in the meetings, and whisper to their
friends. </p>
<p>
<H2>Hosts</h2>
<p>
Hosts are avatars with the authority to log off another avatar (except wizard avatars). This is most commonly 
used to enforce rules of conduct, conversation, or of a scenario. Wizards can designate other avatars to be 
host avatars. 
<p>
<h3>Example of Hosts</h3>
<p>
Frank creates a room for conversations about computer hardware technologies, specifically, graphic cards. 
He designates an avatar to be host and moderate the discussion in the room. If any of the other avatars acts or 
says anything inappropriate, that host can log them off. 
<p>
<h2>Authors</h2>
<p>
When a world is already built, that world may need some help to be customized to match
the initial world design. If an owner needs assistance, or the design of the world is to
grow on its own, then people are granted author status in that world. </p>

<p>As an author, you can create, edit, move, or delete objects that belong to you. You
cannot modify objects that belong to other people or to the owner. This means you can
create additional rooms, portals, walls, chairs, tables, and numerous other items to
further the world's design. You can also add script to these objects to give them
interactive behavior. </p>

<h3>Example of Author</h3>

<p>Jane creates a world that is designed to reproduce an Egyptian pyramid - inside and
out. She creates the initial world and tomb rooms, but needs help finishing the tents of
the explorers outside the tunnel, the mummy's case, and the scripting to translate the
hieroglyphics on the walls to English. She invites Jack, Tom, Jill and Lisa to come to her
world as authors and work on the Egypt objects. Jack does the mummy that unwraps when you
right- click the case, Tom works on the hieroglyphic wall that turns into English, Jill
designs tents for the explorers outside that also shows the history of the original
expedition, and Lisa designs statuettes of the key pieces of the dig to place in the tomb.
</p>

<h2>Wizards</h2>
<p>
Wizards can add, modify, move, or delete any objects in the world.
World owners are wizards by default. Wizards see all the authoring tools.
Wizards can designate other avatars to have wizard, author
or host permissions as well. 
<P>
Wizards can be the designers of an area or the world, and they can help create the world, finish the world, or 
maintain the world. 
<p>
<h3>Example of Wizard</h3>
<p>
Jane creates a world that imitates a outdoor market. She starts by making the meadow and places one market stall 
there for herself. Then she invites other avatars into the world, and designates them as authors to make their 
own market stalls. 
<p>
To help her manage any leftover objects lying about and any problems, she designates her buddy, whose avatar is
Jack, as a wizard. Jack can help fix things and get the world set up. If a stall is placed in the wrong place, 
she or Jack can move it back into position. Jack can also sign up more avatars as authors if more market stalls 
are needed. 
<p>
<h2>Owners</h2>

<p>
Owners create the world and design, customize, and administrate that world. The owner
is sometimes referred to as an &quot;admin.&quot; The owner can create, edit, move or
delete any object in the world they created: they have wizard status by default. The owner can even edit, move,
or delete objects that were not created by them personally, but were placed in their world. </p>

<p>
The owner names the world and can set up a description of the world on the <strong>Directory</strong>
dialog box. The owner can also place the URL of a related web page on the <strong>Directory</strong>
dialog box. This web page can list the download size of the world, a description, maybe
show a few screenshots. </p>
<p>
The owner is the first wizard in a world. Wizards can designate other avatars to be wizards. 

<h3>Example of an Owner</h3>

<p>Jane creates a world and modifies it to her design. She is creating the lost city of
Atlantis, underwater, of course. (You do not need oxygen or gravity in virtual worlds.
Avatars can also fly.) She designs some custom avatars with gills and flippers, and
designs the buildings so you can swim around them. </p>

<p>Jane also invites some friends of hers to enter the world as authors, and they expand
the city, adding more rooms and more interactive objects. </p>

<p>When the world is complete enough, Jane announces it to all her friends, and they hold
a big online meeting there once a week to talk about mysterious places, like the lost city
of Atlantis. She sets up an additional meeting room for a writer's group that likes the
atmosphere. </p>
