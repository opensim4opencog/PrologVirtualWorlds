  <H1>Introduction to Camera Angles</H1>
  <P>
  In Microsoft Virtual Worlds, your avatar can move forwards and backwards, side to side, and sometimes 
  up and down to explore the spaces in a three-dimensional world. All avatars also have a companion camera
  that silently flies alongside your avatar, giving a viewpoint from your avatar's eyes, over their shoulder, or 
  facing the front of your own avatar.
 <p>
  Cameras can also be attached to objects that allow it. You can switch your camera view to that object, and
  see the world from that object's perspective. If the object is moving, your view through the attached
  camera also moves. 
  <p>
  If you attach a camera to an object that was scaled (resized), then the view from the camera changes 
  accordingly. 
  <p>
  If you want to see how you look in the world, you can set the camera to facing yourself, and then check out
  any accessories your avatar is wearing, or gestures that you want to do. It is a bit tricky to navigate
  the world in this mode, because you can not see where you are going.
