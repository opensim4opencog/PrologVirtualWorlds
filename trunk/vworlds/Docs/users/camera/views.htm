  <H1>Changing Camera Views</H1>
  <P>
  All avatars also have a companion camera
  that silently flies alongside your avatar. You can set this camera to see from the avatar's eyes,
  from over the avatar's shoulder, to facing the avatar.
<p>
  Cameras can also be attached to objects that allow it. You can switch your camera view to that object, and
  see the world from that object's perspective. If the object is moving, your view through the attached
  camera also moves. 
  <p>
  If you attach a camera to an object that was scaled (resized), then the view from the camera changes 
  accordingly. 
  <p>

<h4>To change a camera view:</h4>
<oL>
 <li>In the Microsoft Virtual World menu bar, click <b>Camera</b>. <p>
The <b>Camera Views</b> dialog box appears.<p>
 <li>Choose the view you want in the <b>Camera View</b> dialog box: <p>
 	<ul>
	<li><b>Through my eyes</b>
	<li><b>Facing me</b>
	<li><b>Over my shoulder</b>
	<li><b>Attached to an object</b>
	</ul>
	<p>
If no objects appear in the list, then no objects in your room are capable of holding attached cameras. 
<p>
<li>Click <b>Close</b>. 
 </ol>
