  <H1>Tilting the Camera</H1>
 
When moving around in Microsoft Virtual Worlds, you may want to look up into the sky or down at your feet (if
your avatar has feet). You can tip the camera, the silent companion for each avatar, to look up or down. Cameras
show the view from your eyes, over your shoulder, facing you, or attached to other objects. You can tilt the
camera in any of these positions. You can even tilt the camera if you detached it from your avatar.
<p>
 
  
<h4>To tilt the camera:</h4>
<uL>
 <li>Press the <b>Page Up</b> or <b>Page Down</b> keys on the Number Pad. 
 </ul>


<h4>To center the view back to the original point:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Press the <b>Home</b> key.
</ul>
