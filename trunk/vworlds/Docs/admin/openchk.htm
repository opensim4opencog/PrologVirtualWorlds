<h1>Opening a World Checkpoint File</h1>

<p>When you create or save a world, all of the world information
is saved in a binary file format called a <em>checkpoint file</em>.
You can also save (or export) the world information as a
Microsoft Visual Basic Script<font size="2">©</font> file, a
text file. </p>

<p>When the Virtual Worlds Server application starts, it
automatically opens any checkpoint files contained in the
~/Microsoft Virtual Worlds/Worlds directory. However, checkpoint
files added to this directory after the server starts are not
automatically detected. Use this menu option if you have added a
world checkpoint file after the server starts.</p>

<p>You can also use this menu option to restore a world that has
been deleted, providing that the checkpoint backup file still
exists. Both a checkpoint file and a backup checkpoint file are
created when the world is first created, and each is saved
whenever you save your world. For example, if you have created a
world named Home, its checkpoint file would be Home.VWC and the
checkpoint backup file would be Home.BAK.VWC.</p>

<h2>To open a world checkpoint file:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>On the Virtual Worlds Server application's <b>File </b>menu<b>,
        </b>click <b>Open...</b>. </li>
    <li>When the <strong>Open checkpoint file:</strong> dialog
        box appears, select the checkpoint file for the world you
        wish to open. All of the checkpoint files and backup
        checkpoint files are shown in the file explorer pane. </li>
    <li>Click <strong>Open</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Checkpoint files <em>must</em> be
placed in the ~/Microsoft Virtual Worlds/Worlds directory. If you
attempt to open checkpoint files from any other directory, an
error dialog box will be displayed.</p>

<h2>To restore a world that has been deleted:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Using Windows Explorer, rename the file Home.BAK.VWC<tt> </tt>to
        Home.VWC. (The actual file names will probably be
        different.)</li>
    <li>On the Server Administration tool's <b>File </b>menu<b>, </b>click
        <b>Open...</b>. </li>
    <li>When the <strong>Open checkpoint file:</strong> dialog
        box appears, select the checkpoint file for the world you
        wish to open. All of the checkpoint files and backup
        checkpoint files are shown in the file explorer pane. </li>
    <li>Click <strong>Open</strong>.</li>
</ol>
