<h1>Adding Directory Services</h1>

<p>
The <b>Directory</b> shows you which other Virtual Worlds are online, as well as links to
those worlds' web pages, if available, and how many people are logged into that world.
You can also use the directory to enter any linked
world by clicking on an entry. 
<p>
<b>Directory Services</b> is not active right after installing Microsoft Virtual Worlds. To get the <b>Directory</b> entries
for all the worlds, you or your system administrator can set up a server computer to manage the <b>Directory</b>. 
<p>
After you install Virtual Worlds, no entries will appear in the <b>Directory</b> dialog box. In the administration facility, 
<b>Publish to Directory Services</b> will give you an error message. 
<p>
Your system administrator can set up an active <b>Directory Services</b> web server by contacting Virtual Worlds
 (vworlds@microsoft.com) for specific instructions and files. To support a <b>Directory Service</b> for your
 users, your system administrator will need two additional files (an .ASP and a .HTML file) from Microsoft. 
 These files should be installed on a server computer running Windows NT Option Pack, IIS, and Site Server. 
 Your administrator also needs to set two registry keys on every client computer.
