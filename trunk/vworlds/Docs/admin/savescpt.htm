<h1>Exporting a World as a Script File</h1>

<p>After you have made changes to your world, you should back up
your changes. One way to do this is to export the data to a
script file. (The other way is to save the world's data to a
checkpoint file). The script file that is produced contains a
single Microsoft Visual Basic Script<font size="2">©</font>
subroutine named AutoRun. When this script is loaded in the
<a href="../uiref/adminui/import.htm"><b>Import Script Wizard</b></a>,
the subroutine re-creates all of the objects in the world exactly as they were at the
time the script was exported. Although the script can be edited, it is
recommended that do not make changes in this file unless you are sure of
their effects. The script file contains Microsoft Visual Basic
Script<font size="2">©</font> statements that are sensitive to minor changes, as are
statements in any other programming language. </p>

<h2>To export a world as a script file:</h2>

<ol>
    <li class="mvd-P">In the Virtual Worlds Server application,
        click the title bar of the world you want to export. </li>
    <li class="mvd-P">Click the <strong>File</strong> menu, and then click
        <b>Export</b>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Virtual Worlds Server application writes a Microsoft
Visual Basic Script© file containing all of the objects of the
world and their methods and properties. This file is written to
the <tt>Worlds</tt> directory.  The default path to this directory is
<tt>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Virtual Worlds\Worlds\.</tt></p>

<h2>To export a world as a script file, but with a different
name:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>In the Virtual Worlds Server application, click the title
        bar of the world you want to export.</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>File</strong> menu, and then click <strong>Export As...</strong>. </li>
    <li>When the <a href="../uiref/adminui/vwsexp.htm"><strong>Export
        As</strong></a> dialog box appears, type the
        new filename in the <strong>File name</strong> input box.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Virtual Worlds Server application writes out a
Microsoft Visual Basic Script© file to the Worlds directory,
using the name you entered. This file contains all of the
objects and their methods and properties.</p>
