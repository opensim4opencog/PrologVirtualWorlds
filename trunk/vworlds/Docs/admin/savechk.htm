<h1>Saving a World as a Checkpoint File</h1>

<p>After you have made changes to your world, you should save
your changes. One way to do this is to save the world as
a checkpoint file. (You can also save the world in a script
file.)  A Virtual Worlds checkpoint file is a computer-readable
database file that contains all objects in the world, together with
all of their methods and properties.  A checkpoint file has a .VWC
extension. </p>

<p>After you have saved the world, you can restore the world to
its exact state when it was saved. Do this by clicking the <strong>Open...</strong>
menu option on the Virtual Worlds Server application's <strong>File</strong>
menu.  </p>

<p><b>Important!</b>  You can <b>Open...</b> a checkpoint file only if it was saved
by the same version of the Virtual Worlds Server application.  If you plan to
upgrade to a new version of Virtual Worlds, you need to <b>Export</b> the world
as a script file in the old version.  After you have upgraded to the new version
of Virtual Worlds, you can then <b>Import</b> the saved script file. For details, see
<a href="savescpt.htm">Exporting a World as a Script File</a>.<br>

<h2>To save a world as a checkpoint file:</h2>

<ol>
    <li class="mvd-P">In the Virtual Worlds Server application,
        click the title bar of the world you want to save. </li>
    <li class="mvd-P">Click the <strong>File</strong> menu, and then click
        <b>Save</b>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Virtual Worlds Server application writes a
checkpoint file containing all of the objects of the world as
well as their methods and properties. This file is written
to the <tt>Worlds</tt> directory.  The default path to this
directory is <tt>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Virtual World\Worlds\</tt>.</p>

<h2>To save a world as a checkpoint file, but with a different
name:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>In the Virtual Worlds Server application, click the title
        bar of the world you wish to save. </li>
    <li>From the <strong>File </strong>menu, click <strong>Save
        As...</strong>. </li>
    <li>When the <a href="../uiref/adminui/vwssavas.htm"><strong>Save
        As</strong></a> dialog box appears, type the
        new filename in the <strong>File name</strong> input box.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Virtual Worlds Server application writes a checkpoint
file to the <tt>Worlds</tt> directory, using the name you entered.
The default path to this directory is <tt>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Virtual World\Worlds\</tt>.</p>
