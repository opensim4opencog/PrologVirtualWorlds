<h1>Adding Custom Content to a Posted World</h1>

<p>When you make content changes to a world you have already uploaded, or posted to a Web
server, there are things you must do to ensure that clients see those changes. Virtual
Worlds relies on finding content in specific locations.
This content can be remote content on a Web server or in a shared directory on another
computer, or it can be local content on each client. Content on the client computers
must be located in the Local Content directory (or in a subdirectory below it) of
the Virtual Worlds installation directory. The content author determines where
Virtual Worlds finds content by using an URL (Universal Resource Locator) to
locate the content or by setting the <a href="../API%20Reference/World/RootURL.htm">RootURL</a> property of <b>World</b>. </p>

<h2>Posting Custom Avatar Graphics</h2>

<p>After you have created a custom avatar that you would like to make available to users
in your world, you need to post the avatar graphics to the Web server that is hosting your
world's content. The topic <a href="webpost.htm">Moving a World</a> provides information
about moving content from one computer to another.</p>

<h2>Making Custom Avatar Graphics Available to Users</h2>

<p>Once custom avatar graphics have been posted to the Web server, users must download
these files to their computers in order to use of them. This can be done in either of the
two ways listed below.

<ul>
  <li>Users can select the <b>Auto download new avatar graphics</b> option on the <a
    href="../uiref/cliels/options.htm"><b>Options Dialog Box</b></a>. </li>
  <li>Users can manually download the files from the server to their client computers. They
    need to be careful to copy these files to the appropriate directory. (The default
    directory for avatar graphics is <tt>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Virtual Worlds\Local
    Content\Avatar Graphics</tt>.) </li>
</ul>

<h2>Posting Other Custom Content</h2>

<p>When you create custom content other than avatar graphics, view it locally before you
post it to the Web server that hosts your world's content. You can do this by entering the
path to the content in the <b>File path</b> text box of the <a
href="../uiref/proppage/geometry.htm"><b>Geometry Property Page</b></a> (objects with
simple graphics) or the <a href="../uiref/proppage/texture.htm"><b>Texture Property Page</b></a>
(objects with more complex graphics). When you are satisfied with your work, you can post
it to your Web server. Remember that you need to post this file to the same directory on
the Web server.  Another point to consider is that indirectly referenced content, such as a
texture map on a 3D model, also needs to be posted.</p>

<p>If you are creating a lot of content, make one or more new directories for this
content. These directories are displayed in the <b>Models</b> selection box in both the <b>Geometry
Property Page</b> and the <b>Texture Property Page</b>. To view this content locally,
select the appropriate model, and then select the graphics file you want to view from the
file list that appears. When you have completed work on this content, post the directory
(or directories) to your Web server. As above, use the same directory structure on the Web
server as on your local computer.</p>

<p>Content can be stored on any Web server. To associate an object in your world with
content on a Web server, enter the URL for the content in the <b>File path</b> input box
of either the <b>Geometry Property Page</b> or the <b>Texture Property Page</b> for the
object. Here is an example: <tt>http://mywebserver/local
content/sdk/library/models/animal/ant.x</tt>. </p>
