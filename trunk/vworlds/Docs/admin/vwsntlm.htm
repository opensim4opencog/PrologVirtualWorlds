<h1>User Authentication</h1>

<p>Users connecting to the Virtual Worlds server can be authenticated using the NTLM (Windows NT Lan Manager) authentication scheme.
The Virtual Worlds server, when running on Windows NT, can require clients to belong to the same domain if the NTLM Authentication
option is turned on (on by default).  For most intranet scenarios, users will already be authenticated from their initial log on.
<p>
For internet scenarios, or users connecting from outside the domain, they will be presented with the standard Windows NT three-tiered logon dialog box (username, password, domain).  Users, not avatars, must be members of the domain the server occupies in order to complete the connection request.
<p>

<h2>To Toggle User Authentication:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>In the Virtual Worlds Server application, click the <strong>Tools</strong> menu,
	and then click <b>User Authentication...</b>.</li>
<li>Check (or uncheck) the "Require NTLM Authentication for Logins" to turn on (or off) NTLM Authentication.</li>

</ol>
<h2>To Set a Local User Group:</h2>

<p>
You may also further restrict server access by setting a Local Group within the server machine's domain.  If this item is checked, users must belong to that Local Group.

On the server machine,
<ol>
<li>Ensure that you are logged in as an administrator in the local domain
<li>Launch the User Manager from the Administrative Tools Start Menu shortcut (NT4) or Control Panel (Win2K). 
<li>Switch to the local domain (to view local user accounts and groups)
<li>If none of the existing local groups are sufficient, create a new local group via the User->Create New Local Group... menu item, say "VWorldsUsers"
<li>Add users from the broader domain to "VWorldsUsers" or create new user accounts on the local domain and add them to the "VWorldsUsers" local group
<li>If you are providing new user accounts, notify those people of their account information
<li>Launch the Virtual Worlds server application, ensure you check the Require Local Group Membership checkbox in the Tools->User Authentication menu item and fill in the text box with "VWorldsUsers"
</ol>
<p>
Note that users logging in will now have to enter the server name as the domain if Local Group Membership is required.
