<h1>Deleting a World</h1>

<p>If you no longer intend to support a particular world, you can
delete it using the Virtual Worlds Server application. This
operation deletes the checkpoint file (extension .VWC) for the world and removes
its registry key from the Windows registry.   Because deleting a
world removes only the world's checkpoint file, and not its backup
checkpoint file (extension .BAK.VWC), it may still be possible to restore
a world after you have deleted it.</p>

<p>Another reason for deleting a world is to
re-create a world from scratch, using the same name for the
world. In such a case you must delete the world before
you start re-creating it, because world names
must be unique. If you are attempting to create a world, and its
name is already in use, the Virtual Worlds Server
application opens an error dialog box that asks you to choose
a different name. </p>

<p>A world that was deleted can be restored, if you
have not deleted its backup checkpoint file. The <a
href="openchk.htm">Opening a World Checkpoint File</a> topic
explains the steps to open both a checkpoint file and a backup
checkpoint file.</p>

<h2>To delete a world:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>In the Virtual Worlds Server application, click the title
        bar of the world you wish to delete. You do not need to
        open the world before you delete it.</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>File</strong> menu, and then click <b>Delete
        </b>.</li>
</ol>
