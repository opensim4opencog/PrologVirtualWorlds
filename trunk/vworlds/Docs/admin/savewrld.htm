<h1>How Worlds Are Saved</h1>

<p>The Virtual Worlds Server application provides you with the
capability of saving the current state of a world at any time.
After you have taken the world offline, you can then restore it to its saved state.
You can use this capability to "undo" changes made after you saved the world.</p> 

<p>The world data can be saved in either of two different file formats: </p>

<ul>
    <li>as a checkpoint file </li>
    <li>as a Microsoft Visual Basic Script<font size="2">©</font>
        file. </li>
</ul>

<p>The Virtual Worlds Server application's <a
href="../uiref/adminui/vwsfile.htm"><b>File</b></a> menu
distinguishes between these two file formats in its terminology: the <a
href="savechk.htm"><strong>Save</strong></a> option saves
the world to a checkpoint file, while the <a href="savescpt.htm">
<strong>Export</strong></a> option saves the world to a Microsoft Visual
Basic Script<font size="2">©</font> file. </p>

<h2>Saving to a Virtual Worlds Checkpoint File</h2>

<p>The Virtual Worlds checkpoint file is a database of all objects in the world,
together with their methods and properties, organized in a form that the Virtual
Worlds Server application can read. When you click
either the <strong>Save</strong> or <strong>Save As...</strong> menu
options on the <strong>File</strong> menu,
the server creates a checkpoint file. You can restore the world
by clicking the <strong>Open...</strong> menu option on the <strong>File</strong>
menu. One very important point is that the Virtual Worlds Server
application cannot open a checkpoint file that was created by a
different version of Virtual Worlds. To ensure compatibility, always export your world
as a script file before you upgrade to a new version of Virtual Worlds.  After you have
upgraded to the new version, you can import the script file you saved.</p>

<p><b>Tip</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saving a world to a checkpoint file has the added benefit of reducing the overall file size of a world. Periodically saving a world to a checkpoint file can help to reduce the loading time of a world.

<h2>Exporting to a Microsoft Visual Basic Script<font size="3">©</font>
File</h2>

<p>When you click either the <strong>Export</strong> or <strong>Export As...</strong>
menu options on the <strong>File</strong> menu,
the server creates a Microsoft Visual Basic Script<font size="2">©</font>
file. This is a text file consisting of a single subroutine named
AutoRun. (Note: The AutoRun subroutine is executed in the
<a href="../uiref/adminui/import.htm"><b>Import Script Wizard</b></a> when you
<strong>Import...</strong> a
world script file.) Rather than storing all the data for the
world as a checkpoint file does, the script file subroutine
contains Visual Basic Script statements that generate new copies of all of the
world's objects. </p>

<p>Unlike a checkpoint file, a script file can be opened with an
ordinary text editor. The script file contains statements in Microsoft
Visual Basic Script<font size="2">©</font> that are sensitive to small changes, like
statements in any other programming language.  Unless you are fairly certain of the
outcome of changes you make to this file,  it is recommended that you leave the script
file untouched.  </p>

<p>The most important reasons for exporting a world to a script
file are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>to provide compatibility between different versions of the
        Virtual Worlds software. Unlike a checkpoint file, a
        script file can be exported by one version of the server
        application and imported by another.</li>
    <li>to provide greater power, flexibility, and precision to
        those who write scripts than is available with the user
        interface tools. In certain special cases (such as
		<a href="../API%20Reference/Exemplars/StateMachine/StateMachine.htm"><b>StateMachine</b></a>
        objects), there is no other way to access these objects.
        </li>
</ul>
