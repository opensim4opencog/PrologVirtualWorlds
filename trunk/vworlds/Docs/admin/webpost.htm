<h1>Moving a World</h1>

<p>A Virtual World consists of a meta-database and graphic, sound, and other content.  The database,
or <a href="savewrld.htm">checkpoint</a> file, contains information about all the objects in
the world. Content may be located on each
Virtual Worlds client, or it may be accessed remotely by URL
(Uniform Resource Locator) from a shared directory on another computer on an intranet, or from a
Web server.  The world's database, or checkpoint file,
and its content do not need to reside on the same computer.</p>

<p>If necessary, you can move a Virtual World from one server to another. The most common
reason to do this is when you create content on one computer (often local) and
publish the world and its content to another.  This operation requires you to move the world's
checkpoint, and any content that may be on that computer. The first part of this
topic provides information about what to do when you move a world's data to
another server;  the second part provides details on how to move (or <i>publish</i>)
world content from one computer to a Web server using the Microsoft Web Publishing Wizard. </p>

<p>The most important point to keep in mind when you move a world to a new server is that the 
directory structure must be left intact.  If it is not, clients logging on to the new server are
not able to locate the content they need.</p>

<h2>To move the world's data to a new server:</h2>

<h3>When the world's data and its content are located on different computers</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Copy the checkpoint file to its new destination.
	<li>On the destination computer, click the Virtual Worlds Server application's
	<b>File</b> menu option, and then click <b>Open...</b> to open the checkpoint file on the new server.  
</ol>

<h3>When the world's data and its content are located on the same computer, and both are to be moved</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Copy the checkpoint file to the new server.
	<li>Click the Virtual Worlds Server application's <b>File</b> menu option,
	and then click <b>Open...</b> to open the checkpoint file on the new server.  
	<li>Change the <a href="../API%20Reference/World/RootURL.htm">RootURL</a> to include the new
	content path.  Note that to change <b>World</b>
	properties, you must log on to the world using the same avatar that you used to create the world.
</ol>


<p>As an alternative to moving the world's checkpoint file, you can export the
world as a script file, copy the script file to the new server, and then import the file
using the <a href="../uiref/adminui/import.htm"><b>Import Script Wizard</b></a>
in the Virtual Worlds Server application.  If you also intend to move the world's content, however, you must include the new path to this
content in the <b>RootURL</b> property, as detailed in the previous paragraph.</p>


<h2>To publish content to a Web server:</h2>

<p>Before you can publish world content to a Web server, you need to contact the server
administrator to get an account on it.  The server administrator will 
set up a directory for your use, assign you a user name and password on the server, and set
appropriate write permissions for you on that server.</p>

<p>Once you have been given an account on the server, you can then transfer files to the server.
Although there are several ways that this can be done, this focus of this topic is on
transferring files using FTP (File Transfer Protocol).  If you are familiar with FTP, you may
use any FTP client and skip the rest of this section.</p>

<p>To start the <b>Web Publishing Wizard</b>, first click the <b>Start</b> menu, and then click
<b>Programs</b>, then click <b>Internet Explorer</b>, and then
click <b>Web Publishing Wizard</b>. If you do not find
the icon for the <b>Web Publishing Wizard</b>, it may not be installed. You can download
the Web Publishing Wizard from this site: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/">
http://www.microsoft.com/ie/</a></p>

<ol>		
    <li>When the <b>Publish Your Files on the Web</b> Wizard page appears,
	    read the introductory information contained in this page, and
		then click <b>Next</b>.</li>
    <li>On the <b>Select a File or Folder</b> Wizard page, 
        enter the file or folder name of the files you want to
        publish to the Web server. As an alternative, you can
        click the <b>Browse Folder...</b> button to locate the directory
        you want to publish to the server. The <b>Browse Files...</b>
        button displays the files within that directory. When you
        have located the directory you want to publish, click
        <b>Next</b>.</li>
    <li>On the <b>Name the Web Server</b> Wizard page, enter a name to
        describe your Web server. You can type any name you want,
        but it is helpful to use a name that you can easily
        remember. After you have entered a name for the Web
        server, click <b>Advanced</b>.
        </li>
    <li>On the <b>Select Your Service Provider</b> Wizard page,
        choose FTP from the options available in the select option box,
        and then click <b>Next</b>.</li>
    <li>On the <b>Specify the URL and Directory</b> Wizard page,
        enter the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) or Internet
        address of the Web server hosting your web pages. The
        URL or Internet address may look something like this:
		<tt>http://www.microsoft.com/myname</tt>.
        The other text input box on this page should contain the
        local directory (on your computer) that you are
        publishing to the Web server. Click <b>Next</b>.</li>
    <li>On the <b>Specify the FTP Server and Subfolder</b> Wizard page,
        enter the name of your FTP server if it is different from
        your Web server. If you plan to publish files to a
        subdirectory in your account area, enter the name of this
        subdirectory in the <b>Subfolder</b> input box. Click <b>Next</b>.</li>
    <li>On the <b>Publish Your Files</b> Wizard page,
        click <b>Finish</b>. The first time you use the
        Web Publishing Wizard, you see the <b>Enter Network Password</b>
        dialog box. Enter the user name given to you by the Web
        server administrator, and then the password. Note that these
        can be different from the user name and
        password you normally use to log on to your network. Click <b>OK</b>.<br>  The
		<b>Publishing Files</b> dialog box that displays lists the individual
		files being uploaded. When all of the files have been uploaded, another
		dialog box informs you of this. Click <b>OK</b>.</li>
