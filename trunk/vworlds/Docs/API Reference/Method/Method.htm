<P>The <STRONG>Method</STRONG> object is an in-world wrapper for a script subroutine or 
function that is either an inline module or is contained in a script 
module.</P>
<H3>Using the Method Object</H3>
<P>The <STRONG>Method</STRONG> object exists to encapsulate certain pieces of 
information: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Scripting code for an inline method
  <LI> A&nbsp;flag that specifies whether the method is to run on the client,&nbsp;the 
  server, or both, as well as whether the method is to run synchronously or 
  asynchronously
  <LI>The name of the method 
  <LI>The module that contains the script subroutine or function associated 
  with&nbsp;non-inline methods </LI></UL>
<P>Use the <A href="../world/CreateMethod.htm"><STRONG>CreateMethod</STRONG></A> method to create&nbsp;a new method. 
Unless the method you want to create is an inline method, you must add the 
method to a script file and add the file as a module as described in the following 
section Attaching Methods to Objects.</P>
<P>         
             
 If you want to create more than one procedure or function in one 
file, you must add those to Microsoft Virtuals Worlds as a module. To create an inline 
method, use the <A 
href="../World/CreateInlineMethod.htm"><STRONG>CreateInlineMethod</STRONG></A> 
method.</P>
<H4>Attaching Methods to Objects</H4>
<P>You can create a method from a script module, and then attach it to objects 
in Virtual Worlds in order to enable the objects to perform specific 
actions. After you create a method, you can attach it to an object by using the 
<A href="../Thing/AddMethod.htm"><STRONG>AddMethod</STRONG></A>&nbsp;method.</P>
