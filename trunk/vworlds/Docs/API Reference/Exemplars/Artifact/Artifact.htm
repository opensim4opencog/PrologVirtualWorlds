   An artifact can be any object in 
a <A href="../Room/Room.htm">Room</A>, such as a 
table, chair, picture, tree, house, and so on. Artifacts can be classified into two types:&nbsp;A&nbsp;regular 
artifact, such as a chair,&nbsp;or an artifact that&nbsp;can be worn as an accessory. 
<H3> Creating Artifacts</H3>
<p>         
            
        If you want to         
            
        create an artifact that is a chair,&nbsp;you use 
the <A href="../../world/createinstance.htm">CreateInstance</A> method as shown in the following code.
<blockquote><PRE>Set myChair = World.<b>CreateInstance("Chair", "Artifact", _
&nbsp;&nbsp;User.Container)</b></PRE></blockquote>

<P>After you have created the chair, you must specify the graphic you want 
to display for that  artifact.
<p><b>Note:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following URL for "myGraphic" may wrap, depending on the settings for your browser, but it is one continuous line of code.</p>   
<blockquote><PRE>Dim myGraphic

myGraphic = _
"file://C:\Program Files\Microsoft Virtual Worlds\Local 
Content\SDK\Library\Models\Furniture\Chair1.x"

myChair.GeometryName = myGraphic
myChair.Position = 1, 0, 0
</PRE>  
</blockquote><PRE></PRE> 
<p>Virtual Worlds stores the models for the graphics in the 
Microsoft Virtual Worlds\Local Content\SDK\Library\Models folder. However, you 
can use any graphic as long as you specify the complete URL.

<H4>Creating Accessories from Artifacts</H4>
<P>      
 The second type of      
 artifact available in Virtual      
 Worlds is an accessory, which is an artifact that can be worn and has its 
<A href="IsAccessory.htm">IsAccessory</A> property set to <b>True</b>. You can create articles of clothing, such as a hat, for 
your avatar by making your artifact an accessory. The following code statement assumes that you have created an artifact named "StrawHat".
<blockquote>
<p class="comments">'After this statement executes, "StrawHat" will be an accessory.
<pre class="example">StrawHat.<b>IsAccessory</b> = True</pre></blockquote>
<P>After&nbsp;you have created an accessory item, you can use the <A href="../Avatar/Wear.htm">Wear</A> and <A href="../Avatar/UnWear.htm">UnWear</A> 
methods of the 
avatar to add or remove accessories from your avatar, as shown in the following 
statement.
<blockquote>
<p class="comments"> 'This statement adds the accessory to an avatar.
<pre class="example">User.<STRONG>Wear StrawHat</STRONG></pre></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p class="comments"> 'This statement removes the accessory from an avatar.
<pre class="example">User.<STRONG>UnWear StrawHat</STRONG></pre></blockquote>
<p>To display a specific image for your accessory, you can 
use the <A href="AccessoryGraphic.htm">AccessoryGraphic</A> property as shown in the following 
statement. 
<blockquote>
<p class="comments">  'Display the specified image as the accessory.
<pre class="example">StrawHat.<b>AccessoryGraphic</b> = _
    "http://Webs/Scripts/Images/StrawHat.gif"</pre></blockquote>
