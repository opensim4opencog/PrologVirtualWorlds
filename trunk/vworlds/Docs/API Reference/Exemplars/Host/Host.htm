<P class=body>A host is an avatar that can log off other avatars. For example, a <b>Host</b> has the ability to log off an avatar that is not observing established guidelines of conduct in a world.

<!--How-to section -->
<H3>Using the Host Exemplar</H3>
<P>Only wizards can make avatars into hosts or hosts into ordinary avatars. They 
can do this in one of the following two ways: </P>
<UL type=disc>
  <LI>They can use the <a href="../../World/MakeHost.htm">MakeHost</a> or 
  <a href="../../World/UnMakeHost.htm">UnMakeHost</a> methods of the 
  <a href="../../World/World.htm">World</a>. 
  <LI>They can right-click an avatar, choose <STRONG>Properties...</STRONG>, 
  choose <STRONG>Wizard</STRONG>, and then select the check box for 
  <STRONG>Host</STRONG>. </LI></UL>
<P>A host sees an additional menu item, <b>Log Off</b>, when 
she clicks on other avatars that are not wizards. Clicking on this item gives 
her a dialog in which she enters a reason for logging off the user, and then allows her to log off the user. All avatars 
logged on see a message that the host is logging off the user for the given 
reason. A host cannot log off a wizard, but can log off another host. Logging 
off an avatar disconnects him from the world, but he can then log back on.&nbsp;
