<!--Topic Definition-->
<P class=body>The <b>StateMachine</b> exemplar enables an author
to create simple objects with behaviors that can be defined by
states. A state machine's response to a method invoked on it
depends on the current state of the state machine. Actions,
including transitions between states, occur when certain events
take place.&nbsp;

<!--How-to section -->
<H3>Using the Object</H3>
<p>The behavior of a state machine is defined by adding methods,
properties, states, and internal state machines to the object.
Multiple simultaneous, independent, internal state machines allow
more complex objects that react to a number of actions and
transitions (for example, toggling between empty and full, or hot
and cold). A list of all internal state machines for a given <b>StateMachine</b>
object is kept in its <b>StateMachines</b> property.</p>

<p>States are changed by calling <b>SetState</b> (for
the default primary state machine <i>Default</i>) or <b>SetStateMachineState</b> 
(for another internal state machine). When a state is
entered, the state machine looks for a state machine-specific
property with the name <i>TimeOut</i>. If this property has
been set by <b>PutStateProperty</b> (for <i>Default</i>),
or <b>PutStateMachineStateProperty</b> (for another
internal state machine), it represents the number of milliseconds
to wait before calling <i>OnTimeOut</i>, the code for which is
supplied by the user in a call to <b>PutInlineStateMethod</b>.</p>

<p><b>Example:</b> Every state machine that is created
has an internal state machine named <i>Default</i>, which might
start in the <i>Waiting</i> state. The pre-defined method 
<a href="../../Events/OnLButtonUp.htm">OnLButtonUp</a>
could then be added to this state so that a transition to a
different state would occur when the user clicked the left mouse
button over the object.&nbsp;
