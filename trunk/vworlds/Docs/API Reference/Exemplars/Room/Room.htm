<H3>Using the   Object</H3>
<p>Objects and avatars within the same room are
aware of each other's existence and actions. Rooms serve as the
boundaries for conversations, client-server communication, event
dispatching, and many other things. Rooms also support room
portals and interworld portals, which are gateways to other rooms and
worlds.&nbsp;
