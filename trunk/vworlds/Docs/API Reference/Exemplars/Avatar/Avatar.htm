<H3>Using the Object</H3>
<p>An <b>Avatar</b> object is a representation of the user in
the three-dimensional virtual world, as well as the conduit for
the user's manipulation of the world. One can think of an avatar as a puppet that is controlled by its user. An avatar can display moods and
perform gestures, including gestures involving other avatars or
other objects. Because an avatar is assumed to be linked to a
conscious, controlling entity (such as a user), it is given a
rich set of events to act upon. </p>

<p>An avatar object has a profile (of type 
<a href="../../AvatarProfile/AvatarProfile.htm">AvatarProfile</a>)
associated with it, which acts as a set of preferences, history,
and facts about the user who owns the avatar.</p>

<p>The first avatar who connects to a world is the world owner,
which makes the user associated with this avatar both a wizard and an author.
That is, the avatar's <b>IsAuthor</b> and <b>IsWizard</b> properties are both
set to <b>True</b>. These properties cannot be changed by anyone. The owner of a world can
change certain properties specific to that world that no one else can change.&nbsp;
