<H3>Using the Object</H3>
<p>When activated, a WebPage object opens a browser window and displays some
content located at an URL.  The URL is stored as a property of the WebPage object.</p>

<p>WebPage objects can be used for a variety of purposes, depending on
the geometry that represents the object in the world. They can
be used to create notes, newspapers, instructions, newbie
information, links to external web pages, and so forth. </p>
