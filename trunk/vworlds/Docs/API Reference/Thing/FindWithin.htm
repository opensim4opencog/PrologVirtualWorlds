<!--Return Value section -->
<H3>Return Value</h3>
<p>
This method returns a <b>Thing</b>.

<!--Remarks section-->
<H3>Remarks</H3>
<P>The invoking object should be the container that is to be searched to find the
requested object. </p>

<p>If <b>FindWithin</b> is successful, it displays <tt>OK</tt> in the <b>Command Window</b>. 
If the requested object cannot be found, it displays <tt>Failed to find 
"&lt;ObjectName&gt;" within "&lt;Container&gt;"</tt>.</p>

<p>When <b>FindWithin</b> is called from the server, it is able to find anything
for which it is searching, in the container. When <b>FindWithin</b> is called
from a client, however, it may not find every object in the same container, because
clients have only a subset of the objects in a world. Specifically, only those objects in
the same room as your avatar exist on your client. Such objects as another avatar's
contents or the contents of closed containers are not sent to the client, and cannot be
found by <b>FindWithin</b> if it is called from the client. </p>

<p>If the object is not being marshalled (for example, if you call this method on the client 
to find an object that isn't being regularly marshalled to your client), you will get only a 
momentary, one-time copy of the object. The original object, from which the copy was made, may 
undergo further changes after you have gotten the copy.
