<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>Microsoft Virtual Worlds is a 
		software platform that helps you build environments in two or three dimensions 
		that you can share with other people at the same time. You can use these 
		environments for a variety of purposes, such as collaboration, education, 
		entertainment, and commerce. The platform supports text, graphics, voice, 
		video, and many other media types. Environments can range from immersive 
		three-dimensional worlds where people (represented as avatars) can see and 
		interact with other avatars in a number of ways, to simpler non-graphical 
		environments using synchronous communication, as in distance-learning classrooms.<P> 
		With Microsoft Virtual Worlds, you can create worlds and objects in minutes using 
		wizards and standard content. Changes end-users have made to the world persist 
		between sessions, and you can edit objects, content, and behaviors in the world 
		while the world is running. The interface is easily customizable with DHTML and 
		VBScript, and you can create and control objects and their behaviors with script 
		as well.&nbsp;
