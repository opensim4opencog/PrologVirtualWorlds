<h1>Virtual Worlds Methods</h1>

<p><!-- 10/23/98 --></p>

<p>There are three types of methods in Virtual Worlds:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Script Methods 
    <li>Inline Methods 
  <LI>System Methods</LI>
</ul>

<h2>Script Methods</h2>

<p>A script method is a subroutine or function written in Microsoft
Visual Basic Scripting Edition<font size="2">© or 
Microsoft JScript<FONT size=2>©</FONT></font>. Before you start to write the code
for your method, consider whether the method should return a value. If the
method does not need to return a value, write a
subroutine to implement your method. If the method does need to
return a value, write a function. </p>

<p>Once you have decided whether to implement your method as a
subroutine or as a function, you can carry out the following 
four-step process in order to add the method to an object: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Create a text file that contains one or more script 
  subroutines or functions. Each of these subroutines and functions could 
  potentially become a method on an object. 
    <li>Create a script module from this file. 
    <li>Create a method from the script module. 
    <li>Add the method to the appropriate object.</li>
</ol>

<p>These steps are examined in detail in the topic <a href="Creating%20a%20Method%20from%20a%20Module.htm">Adding a Method from a Script Module</a>.</p>
<P>   Note that once a module is created from a text file containing 
script code, the actual code in the module is not updated unless you explicitly 
reload the module.&nbsp; Simply changing code in the text file will not cause 
the module to be reloaded.</P>

<h2>Inline Methods</h2>

<p>   An inline method is a type of method that
is not associated with an external module. In contrast, script methods <em>are</em>
associated with external modules. The inline method type is ideal for
writing methods that can be completed within short code fragments. Unlike script methods, inline
methods can be edited in the <A href="../../uiref/objexpl/inlinmth.htm"><b>Inline Method Editor</b></A>
(one of the editors in the <A href="../../uiref/objexpl/intrface.htm"><b>Object Explorer</b></A>).
Also, if a change is made to an inline method, the server and
other clients will automatically be updated.  This is not true of script methods.</p>

<p>All inline methods are associated with a single internal
inline script module.</p>

<p>The topic <a href="Writing%20an%20Inline%20Method.htm">Writing an Inline Method</a> contains more
information.</p>

<h2>System Methods</h2>

<p>All of the Virtual Worlds core objects and exemplars 
have native methods that are implemented in C++.&nbsp; These methods cannot 
explicitly be changed by the user, but many of them can be <EM>overridden</EM>                
       by re-implementing
the methods as script or inline methods. </p>
