<h1>Filtering and Sorting Methods</h1>

<p><!-- 11/2/98 --></p>

<p>When you open the <a href="../../uiref/objexpl/intrface.htm"><b>Object Explorer</b></a>, and you
select an object in the current room, the <b>Object Explorer</b>
displays all methods (and properties) on that object. Some of the
displayed methods are inherited from the object's exemplar, while
the rest are instance methods that are specific to that object.
By filtering the methods, you can specify that <em>only</em>
exemplar methods should be displayed, or <em>only</em> instance
methods, or both types. </p>

<p>You can also sort methods by name, by the module they belong
to, or by the subroutine name within the module.</p>

<p>Learn more about:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Method Filtering Options</li>
    <li>Method Sorting Options</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method Filtering Options</h2>

<p>When you filter methods, you are not deleting any of them; you
are telling the <b>Object Explorer</b> not to
display the ones that have been filtered out. You can set filtering options
separately for properties and methods. </p>

<p>Filtering options persist when you change the selected object
and view another object's methods. For example, if
you have changed the filtering so that only instance methods are
visible, you must change the filtering back in order to see the
exemplar methods in any other object in your virtual
world. By default, all methods (exemplar and instance) are
displayed.</p>

<h3>To display <em>only</em> instance methods for an object:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Right-click anywhere in the object's <b>Methods</b> pane.</li>
    <li>If a check mark is displayed on <b>Show Exemplar
        Methods</b>, click this menu item to turn this option off. (Note: if no check mark is displayed, you
        are already seeing only the instance methods.)</li>
</ol>

<h3>To display <em>only</em> exemplar methods for an object:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Right-click anywhere in the object's <b>Methods</b> pane.</li>
    <li>If a check mark is displayed on <b>Show Instance
        Methods</b>, click this menu item to turn this option off. (Note: if no check mark is displayed, you
        are already seeing only the exemplar methods.)</li>
</ol>

<h3>To display all methods for an object:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Right-click anywhere in the object's <b>Methods</b> pane.</li>
    <li>If either the <b>Show Instance Methods</b> menu
        item or the <b>Show Exemplar Methods</b> menu
        item is unchecked, click that menu item to turn that option on. (Note: if neither
		check mark is displayed, you will need to carry out these steps twice, once for
        each menu item.)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Method Sorting Options</h2>

<p>You can sort an object's methods in any of three ways:
<ul>
<li>by method name
<li>by the name of the module that contains it
<li>by the name of the subroutine within the module
</ul>
</p>
<p>Each sorting option is done alphabetically. Sorting options persist. When you
select another object, its methods will be sorted using the
option you selected previously. By default, methods are sorted by
name.</p>

<h3>To sort methods by <em>name</em>:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Select the object whose methods you want to sort.</li>
    <li>In the <b>Methods</b> pane for the object,
        click the <b>Name</b> tab.</li>
</ol>

<h3>To sort methods by <em>module</em>:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Select the object whose methods you want to sort.</li>
    <li>In the <b>Methods</b> pane for the object,
        click the <b>Module</b> tab.</li>
</ol>

<h3>To sort methods by <em>subroutine name</em>:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Select the object whose methods you want to sort.</li>
    <li>In the <b>Methods</b> pane for the object,
        click the <b>Subroutine</b> tab.</li>
</ol>
