<h1>Filtering and Sorting Properties</h1>

<p><!-- 10/23/98 --></p>

<p>When you open the <a href="../../uiref/objexpl/intrface.htm"><b>Object Explorer</b></a>, and you
select an object in the current room, the <b>Object Explorer</b>
displays all properties (and methods) on that object. Some of the
displayed properties are inherited from the object's exemplar,
while the rest are instance properties that are specific to that
object. By filtering the properties, you can specify that <em>only</em>
exemplar properties should be displayed, or <em>only</em>
instance properties, or both types. </p>

<p>You can also sort properties by name, by type, or by value.</p>

<p>Learn more about:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Property Filtering Options</li>
    <li>Property Sorting Options</li>
</ul>

<h2>Property Filtering Options</h2>

<p>When you filter properties, you are not deleting any of them; you are
telling the <b>Object Explorer</b> not to
display the ones that are filtered out. You can set filtering options
separately for properties and methods. </p>

<p>Filtering options persist when you change the selected object
and view another object's properties. For example, if
you have changed the filtering so that only instance properties are
visible, you must change the filtering back in order to see the
exemplar properties in any other object in your virtual
world. By default, all properties (exemplar and instance) are
displayed.</p>

<h3>To display <em>only</em> instance properties for an object:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Right-click anywhere in the object's <b>Properties</b>
        pane.</li>
    <li>If a check mark is displayed on <b>Show Exemplar
        Properties</b>, click this menu item to turn this option off. (Note: if no check mark is displayed, you
        are already seeing only instance properties.)</li>
</ol>

<h3>To display <em>only</em> exemplar properties for an object:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Right-click anywhere in the object's <b>Properties</b>
        pane.</li>
    <li>If a check mark is displayed on <b>Show Instance
        Properties</b>, click this menu item to turn this option off. (Note: if no check mark is displayed, you
        are already seeing only exemplar properties.)</li>
</ol>

<h3>To display all properties for an object:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Right-click anywhere in the object's <b>Properties</b>
        pane.</li>
    <li>If either the <b>Show Instance properties</b>
        menu item or the <b>Show Exemplar Properties</b>
        menu item is unchecked, click that menu item to turn that option on. (Note: if neither check mark is displayed,
        you will need to carry out these steps twice, once for
        each menu item, to turn on both options.)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Property Sorting Options</h2>

<p>You can sort an object's properties in any of three ways:
<ul>
<li>by name
<li>by type
<li>by value
</ul>
</p>
<p>The first and second sorting options
are done alphabetically. The third sorts values with blanks
first, then numbers in numerical order, and then strings in
alphabetic order. Sorting options persist. When you
select another object, its properties are sorted using the
option you selected previously. By default, properties are sorted
by name.</p>

<h3>To sort properties by <em>name</em>:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Select the object whose properties you want to sort.</li>
    <li>In the <b>Properties</b> pane for the object,
        click the <b>Name</b> tab.</li>
</ol>

<h3>To sort properties by <em>module</em>:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Select the object whose properties you want to sort.</li>
    <li>In the <b>Properties</b> pane for the object,
        click the <b>Type</b> tab.</li>
</ol>

<h3>To sort properties by <em>subroutine name</em>:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Select the object whose properties you want to sort.</li>
    <li>In the <b>Properties</b> pane for the object,
        click the <b>Value</b> tab.</li>
</ol>
