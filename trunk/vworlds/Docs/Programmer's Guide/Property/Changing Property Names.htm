<h1>Changing Property Names</h1>

<p><!-- 10/23/98 --></p>

<p>Editing property names can have one of the following results:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You cannot edit the name of a property that has been
        inherited from an exemplar. You must first copy the
        property (by editing its value) to create an object-local
        version of it, and then you will be able to change the
        property's name. </li>
    <li>If you edit the name of a property that was inherited
        from an exemplar but has a new value, then you will
        actually create a new local version of that property, of
        the same type and value as the original but with your new
        name. The original exemplar property with the old name
        will not be deleted; it still remains in the object,
        unchanged. </li>
    <li>If you edit the name of a property that exists only in
        the object instance, then you are in fact changing the
        name of that property. No property with the old name
        remains, it will be replaced by the property with the new
        name. However, be aware that renaming a property in this
        way can potentially break any references made to the
        property's old name. </li>
</ul>
